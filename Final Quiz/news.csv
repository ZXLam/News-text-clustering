The smartphone market is saturated. Apple’s revenue growth is slowing. There is no upside to Apple’s $1.37 trillion market cap.

I’m probably not even up to speed on what the Apple bears are saying in 2020. But whatever it is, Apple investors should expect more of the same from one of the top stocks and companies of the past two decades.

The company and the stock just keep right on chugging, including another 7.6% gain in 2020. Apple is no longer a potential home run, 10-bagger stock. But I believe Apple is the quintessential blue-chip stock to own for long-term investors in the 2020s.

Near-Term Outlook

AAPL stock is not immune to Covid-19 disruptions. Fortunately, Apple’s services revenue is mostly immune to disruption. At the same time, its upcoming iPhone 12 launch is the potential catalyst the company needs to get its business back on the right track.

Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives estimates there are 350 million iPhone users around the world that have devices that have not been upgraded in at least 42 months. Given Apple’s impressive customer loyalty statistics, Ives says the vast majority of these iPhone users will upgrade sometime within the next two years.

Many AAPL stock bulls are optimistic that the company will release its first 5G iPhone in September. However, Ives is bullish on AAPL stock even if the 5G iPhone release is delayed.

“Our recent Asia checks and supply chain contacts are looking at iPhone units in the 165 million to 185 million range for CY20 with strong underlying momentum into CY21 on the heels of iPhone 12,” Ives says. “From a timing perspective, we continue to believe there are 4 models being discussed for iPhone 12 with a mix of 4G/5G that will likely be launched in the November/early December timeframe ahead of holiday season.”

Ives estimates Apple’s services segment alone is worth between $500 billion and $600 billion. The services segment also helped insulate AAPL stock from a worst-case novel coronavirus scenario.

Wedbush has a “buy” rating and $350 price target for AAPL stock.

Diversified Business Model

For years, Apple was considered a hardware company that relied on iPhone device sales to drive the top and bottom line. But this is not your father’s Apple. For the past several years, Apple committed to a pair of initiatives that helped diversify its business model.

The first change was increasing the company’s reliance on services revenue. No matter how successful Apple is in penetrating the global smartphone market, penetration is capped at 100%. In other words, even if everyone in the world eventually owns an iPhone, I can’t see a good reason for someone to own two iPhones.

But by pivoting to services revenue, there is no ceiling on the company’s potential growth. The average iPhone user could spend 99 cents per month on services. Or they could spend $9.99 or they could spend $99. As long as Apple keeps coming up with services people want and need, Apple’s revenue can keep growing. In the meantime, all iPhone users will still be forced to upgrade their phones every few years.

Argus analyst Jim Kelleher says Apple’s business has the ideal diversification for the current situation.

“Apple possesses multiple strengths to help carry it through this difficult period, including wearables (Air Pods), services (Apple Play), and a strong online business,” Kelleher says.

Kelleher also said Apple has expanded outside of the high-end smartphone market in recent years. It has extended its reach to new markets.

“The successful diversification of iPhone across multiple price points has broadened the available market and driven segment revenue growth,” Kelleher says.

Argus has a “buy” rating and $350 price target for AAPL stock.

How to Play AAPL Stock

Given the potential for Apple to grow its average revenue per user over time, the AAPL stock bull case is alive and well. At the same time, iPhone upgrades will continue to be a cash cow for Apple. If Apple can create similar hardware upgrade cycles with its wearable devices, that will be icing on the cake.

In the meantime, Apple has a massive cash stockpile. It will continue to return that cash to shareholders as it pushes toward its goal of becoming cash neutral over time.

Given the current macroeconomic circumstances, it’s hard to find a stock that has a similar combination of cash flow, capital return, attractive valuation and long-term growth opportunities. Apple may not have the explosive growth potential it used to. However, AAPL stock may be the best long-term blue-chip stock to buy in the market today.

Here’s What It Bought.",https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCVsUcte_GIA2R7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411756/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.barrons.com%2farticles%2fa-top-pension-sold-apple-stock-amazon-disney-ge-51590075918/RK=2/RS=Wx_Qbcz6nPJrHaQIqoNdLZbSgKE-,None,"Text size

The Tennessee Department of Treasury made some big changes in its stock investments in the first quarter, a period that was rocked by the coronavirus pandemic.

The treasury oversees all of the state’s investments of which the largest component is the state’s pension, the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System. The pension, which had net assets of $52.1 billion as of June 30, 2019, is one of the best in the country, from a funding standpoint. A study by the Pew Charitable Trusts using 2017 data showed that Tennessee’s pension was 96.5% funded—that is, short 3.5 cents for every dollar of liability. The average state pension was 31 cents short.

The Department of Treasury sold all its Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Amazon. com stock (AMZN) in the first quarter. The pension manager also slashed its position in Walt Disney (DIS), and bought General Electric stock (GE). It disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form the agency filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The state’s treasury owned 2.4 million Apple shares at the end of 2019, but sold them all by March 31.

Apple stock has surged 25.4% so far in the second quarter through Friday’s close, topping the 14.3% rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Apple has more than erased a 13.4% drop in the first quarter.

The iPhone maker has once again been caught in trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Nonetheless, Apple has persisted in boosting its streaming capabilities.

Amazon stock has also seen a second-quarter lift, rising 25.0% after a 5.5% rise in the first.

Amazon recently disclosed that it is developing its own Covid-19 testing capabilities. Even as the coronavirus pandemic continues, Amazon stock has benefited from investors buying up stay-at-home stocks.

Tennessee’s treasury sold 257,098 Amazon shares in the first quarter to end the period with none.

It also sold 393,949 shares of media and entertainment giant Disney, reducing the treasury’s investment to 1 million shares.

Editor's Choice

Disney stock has rallied 22.2% so far in the second quarter, but remains in the red for the year after the first quarter’s 33.2% plunge.

Most of Disney’s theme parks remain closed, but Shanghai Disneyland recently reopened. The head of the company’s streaming unit Disney+ has just decamped for an executive position with the Chinese company that operates video platform TikTok.

The treasury also bought 919,230 GE shares in the first quarter to raise its stake in the embattled manufacturing giant to 3 million shares.

GE stock has slid 19.3% so far in the second quarter, following a 28.9% drop in the first.

Shares have slid in May to lows not seen in decades. GE has been hammered by a number of factors in the coronavirus era. There’s less demand for its jet engines when airlines are struggling. Also, low interest rates and slower economic growth are hurting GE Capital and Power business units. However, some observers remain bullish on GE stock.

While the iPhone maker is still mainly focused on original programming for Apple TV+, Apple realizes it needs to offer a variety of content to take on the streaming leaders, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple TV+ has around 30 original shows and movies on its platform, which costs $4.99 a month. Compare this to Netflix, which has thousands of pieces of content users can stream, although Netflix does charge more, coming in at $8.99 a month for its cheapest package.

The move may be necessary for Apple. The sources told Bloomberg that about 10 million people have become customers of Apple TV+ as of February, but only around 5 million use it actively. That's amid the COVID-19 pandemic where shelter in place rules have driven demand for streaming content. With millions of people turning to streaming platforms to kill boredom during the pandemic, Apple is realizing it needs more content to keep users engaged. Apple is also seeing an uptick in usage and has taken steps to make its service more desirable during the pandemic. Last month, it started letting users watch certain shows for free."
3,Why Apple’s Stock Can Keep Growing During a Global Recession,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCVsUcte_GIA3R7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByc3RzMXFjBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM0BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411756/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2faapl-stock-can-grow-during-recession%2f/RK=2/RS=rywLko4SjhZ.hciFKgAxhEZkRbE-,2020-05-19 09:00:21-04:00,"The last time I talked about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), it was to highlight the innovative culture that I think will continue to drive AAPL stock higher for the foreseeable future.

Source: NYC Russ / Shutterstock.com

But now I want to revisit the Cupertino, California-based tech giant to talk about something just as compelling — Apple’s ability to grow even during the teeth of what appears to be a burgeoning global recession.

It’s not every company that can manage to sustain a growth rate during a recession, but I’m banking on Apple to confound expectations. Because this is much more than a smartphone company. And it has already shown that its shrugging off the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic and getting back to business.

The business of making money, that is.

A Bullish Call on Apple

Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan is projecting Apple’s revenue to sink by only 2% in the first quarter of 2020, due in large part to the Covid-19 pandemic that erupted in China and spread around the world.

But that’s just a blip. In fact, Mohan believes that AAPL will recover quickly, earning $263.21 billion in revenue in 2020, which would be a 1.2% growth rate even as the U.S. sinks into a recession.

How does that happen?

Part of it is Apple’s diversified nature. While it made its bones on smartphones and computers, Apple has successfully grown its Services revenue in recent quarters to the point that it can help sustain the company even when a pandemic shuts down its factories and grinds supply lines to a halt.

The Services segment, which includes everything from Apple Music, the App Store and Apple News, is critically important to AAPL stock because it’s a high-margin business. Apple charges fees to content developers to sell products on Apple’s platform, so Apple avoids all the R&D costs that affects the bottom line of its computer, wearables and smartphone businesses.

In fact, Apple actually enjoys a higher profit margin from its Services segment than it gets from its entertainment division or its popular smartphones.

It was the Services division that got a special shout-out from CEO Tim Cook when the company reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings last month.

“Despite COVID-19’s unprecedented global impact, we’re proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter, driven by an all-time record in Services and a quarterly record for Wearables … In this difficult environment, our users are depending on Apple products in renewed ways to stay connected, informed, creative, and productive.”

For the quarter, the company reported earning $13.3 billion from its Services segment, which was up 16% from a year ago. The company earned revenue of $58.31 billion for the quarter overall, with earnings per share of $2.55. That beat analysts’ expectations of $54.54 billion in revenue and EPS of $2.26.

Production Is in High Gear

While companies in the U.S. are still inching toward reopening, Apple’s supply lines have already returned to normal in China, Mohan says.

Foxconn, which is Apple’s top iPhone manufacturer, announced in mid-March that it was back to full production, and Apple’s production levels returned to normal in China by the end of March.

That means Apple should be able to launch its newest iPhone, featuring 5G technology, by the end of the year. I’ve made no secret about the importance of 5G technology, so this is a development I’m really looking forward to.

Renderings of the phone indicate this the next iPhone will include the biggest design change since the iPhone X in 2017, and that should also trigger plenty of iPhone sales.

Apple’s incredible employees were already able to launch new iPad Pro and MacBook Air models in the most recent quarter while working from home, so I have no doubts that the 5G smartphone will be out by the end of the year.

The Bottom Line on AAPL Stock

Apple is an extraordinary company. Boasting a market capitalization of $1.3 trillion and a net cash position of $83 billion, it is uniquely positioned to handle the economic downturn, no matter how long it lasts.

While other companies struggle, AAPL is maintaining its commitment to shareholders by returning value. In the most recent quarter, Apple had $18.5 billion in stock buybacks and issued $3.4 billion in dividends. The company also announced a new $50 billion buyback authorization.

The dividend, while small at 1.1% yield, also got a 6% boost and has now been growing for seven consecutive years.

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) - Get Report and Apple Inc. (AAPL) - Get Report are unlikely to become technology partners, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a client note published Thursday, but the clean-energy carmaker might be on a path similar to the iPhone giants over the next two decades.

Huberty, a highly-influential Wall Street analyst with a track record for accurately forecasting Apple earnings, told her colleague, Tesla analyst Adam Jonas, that the two companies will be viewed as competitors in the years ahead, with vertically integrated solutions that would make a partnership unlikely.

Tech investors, Huberty said, ""View Tesla in a way they viewed Apple 20 years ago: a company that thinks differently, that is incredibly innovative in a category that needs a spurt of innovation.""

""That creates investor interest. If there’s a path to profitability and reason to believe scale will continue to increase, then tech investors tend to not care as much about valuation and/or are will to look multiple years into the future when scale and profitability will support current valuation,"" she added.

Tesla shares were marked 0.5% higher Thursday at $819.20 each, but have risen nearly 95% so far this year as Elon Musk's group rolled out new models and boosted profitability amid record quarterly deliveries.

Apple shares, meanwhile, were marked 0.1% lower at $319.00 each, weighed down by U.S.-China trade tensions and a pullback in broader equity markets, but have gained 8.5% this year against a 13.8% decline for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Tesla produced just under 103,000 cars over the three months ending in March, with deliveries pegged at 88,400, the best first-quarter total in the company's history, and stuck to its guidance of delivering 500,000 cars this year.

Apple beat Street estimates for both its top and bottom line over its fiscal second quarter, posting sales of $58.3 billion and earnings of $2.55 per share for the three months ending in March.

The results were even more impressive considering iPhone revenues fell 6.7% to $29 billion as stores in China, and around the world, were shuttered as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

Apple said services revenues picked up some of the slack, rising 17% to a record $13.3 billion as shelter-in-place orders attracted new subscribers to the group's suite of cloud-based offerings such as Apple Music and Apple Pay.

Apple's services subscriber base hit 515 million over the second quarter, Cook said, while its installed base -- a measure of the number of iPhones, iPad, and computers in circulation -- topped 1.5 billion."
5,Apple (AAPL) to Beef Up TV+ Content Library With Popular Shows,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCVsUcte_GIA4R7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByNDZ0aWFxBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM2BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411756/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.investing.com%2fanalysis%2fapple-aapl-to-beef-up-tv-content-library-with-popular-shows-200525470/RK=2/RS=Madtezwya4VvXT_JMqGvRy5aq7o-,None,"Apple AAPL is looking to strengthen its content library with some older films and television series.



The tech giant has only released Apple original TV shows and movies since its launch. However, off-late the streaming service has been in talks with Hollywood executives about licensing older content, per a Bloomberg report.



Apple TV+, which costs only $4.99 per month with the sole target of streaming original series, movies, and documentaries, currently offers just 30 original shows and movies. However, it provides app users access to HBO, Showtime and other services for broader content variety.



However, the spread of coronavirus has shut down film and television production since mid-March. This will likely cause delays in Apple TV+ originals set to come out later this year and early 2021.



With fewer new originals in the pipeline and free trials starting to expire, the need for additional content is even more acute.



Rivals Gain on Backlog Content



Apple TV+’s direct competitors have found a lot of success in balancing the scales between developing original content and providing their audience with a backlog of licensed content.



Lacking the kind of back catalog that Walt Disney DIS and Warner own and that Amazon AMZN and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) NFLX first acquired and then built, Apple’s limited original content library and a low cost of entry strategy have struggled to attract subscribers.



As of the end of February, Apple TV+ had 10 million users but the majority of those subscribers aren't paying for the service, which offered a free, year-long subscription for users who signed up immediately after its launch.



Netflix, by contrast, has more than 183 million subscribers while Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ on launch day (including presales and free trials), and reported 54.5 million subscribers as of the beginning of May.



Among popular content on Netflix in terms of time spent watching is old licensed series. As many media companies move to take back the streaming licenses on their most popular old shows, companies like Netflix are forced to pay extremely high prices for the few popular shows left available to license.



Shows like The Office and Friends, the latter of which is moving to HBO Max, became premier titles for Netflix while it bought the rights to Seinfeld for over $500 million.



Apple’s Efforts to Beat Competition



While acquiring the license to TV shows and movies should help bolster Apple TV+’s catalogue, it is also expected to be expensive.



Nonetheless, continued momentum in service offerings amid coronavirus-led lockdown is expected to aid Apple in the near term, Notably, Services (22.9% of sales) revenues grew 16.6% from the year-ago quarter to $13.35 billion, a record in the company’s history.



Apple is taking various other measures to improve subscriber growth on its Tv+ platform. From mid-April 2020, the company made a number of Apple TV+ shows free to watch, including popular shows such as Little America, Servant, For All Mankind and Dickinson.



Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has begun acquiring two types of original podcasts — one category is audio spinoffs of existing movies and programs on Apple TV+ service, and the other is original programs that could eventually be adapted into future TV+ video content. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.



Apple has asked some producers working on podcasts to provide versions of their offerings without advertisements, which fit into TV+’s ad-free approach.



Moreover, Apple TV+ will launch Greyhound, a World War II drama starring and written by Tom Hanks and produced by Sony (NYSE: ) Pictures. The film had originally been targeted for a theatrical release on Father’s Day weekend. Apple paid $70 million for the Sony Pictures movie.

Apple has more than 1.5 billion active users across its iDevices, while Netflix boasts a fast-growing member base of 182.86 million.

While both companies face some headwinds in the near term due to the coronavirus economy, both are in a good position to get through 2020 and continue growing over the long term. Let's see which stock is the better buy today.

Financial position

The near-term economic picture is looking very bleak. More than 20 million people lost their jobs in April alone, which will lead to lower consumer spending. But Apple and Neflix will be fine due to strong underlying business operations.

Apple has more than $83 billion in net cash. That is plenty of cash to invest for growth and maintain its dividend to shareholders, which recently increased by 6% to a quarterly payout of $0.82 per share.

Netflix doesn't have the cash-rich balance sheet like Apple. As of the most recent quarter, Netflix carried $14.7 billion of debt with only $5.15 billion in cash on its balance sheet. But Netflix can get away with this because it makes money from monthly subscriptions that provide a recurring revenue stream to pay expenses and invest in new content.

Current state of Apple

Apple is seeing strong demand in some areas but weakness in others. The main headwind in the near term is weak demand for iPhones. The iPhone comprises half of Apple's revenue. During its fiscal second-quarter conference call, management warned that sales of iPhones and wearables (e.g., Apple Watch) would worsen through June, but management didn't provide specific guidance for sales or earnings.

However, Apple is seeing strong demand for services, specifically Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Card. While these services continue to add users, Apple reported during its conference call that its Apple Care warranty program and advertising business in the App Store has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus.

Overall, the services business, which is Apple's fastest-growing revenue stream and represented 23% of total revenue last quarter, should continue to perform well.

Apple also expects sales of iPads and Macs to improve through June. CEO Tim Cook attributed this to more people working at home and needing some extra tools to remain productive.

For what it's worth, Wall Street analysts currently expect Apple to grow sales by 1% in fiscal 2020 (which ends in September). Analysts expect earnings per share to increase 3.6% year over year. But in fiscal 2021, revenue growth is expected to accelerate to 12.5%, likely reflecting a strong upgrade cycle for the next iPhone, which is expected to feature 5G wireless connection capability.

Current state of Netflix

Netflix is experiencing some disruption from the novel coronavirus. Filming has stopped globally, and Netflix hasn't been able to get voice dubbing completed for some foreign releases. The good news is that Netflix has already completed filming for several projects scheduled for release this year and through 2021.

Although this isn't the ideal situation, Netflix is thriving in this environment. The company added 15.77 million new subscribers in the first quarter, which blew away expectations. However, management cautioned that this growth is probably coming from those who were likely going to subscribe in the next quarter anyway, which may limit growth in the next few quarters.

Although revenue jumped 27.6% year over year in the last quarter, management expects viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate once people return to their normal social life.

The biggest takeaway from the first quarter is the tremendous value consumers are finding in the vast content library, which points to growing brand value.

Analysts currently expect Netflix to grow revenue by 22.9% year over year in 2020, while earnings are expected to increase by 56% to reach $6.46.

Which stock is the better buy?

I wouldn't be afraid of holding either of these FAANG stocks right now. But if I were choosing only one to buy today, I would invest in the company that is growing faster, and that is Netflix.

Sales of the iPhone have hit a saturation point, which is why Apple has only grown its revenue by a total of 20% over the last three years. But Netflix is still growing its revenue at more than 20%, which reflects the advantage the streaming provider has growing off a smaller revenue base compared to Apple. Apple generated $268 billion in revenue over the last four quarters, compared to $21.4 billion at Netflix.

Dividend investors will like Apple for its $60 billion of annual free cash flow and regular quarterly dividend. But Netflix offers more growth. The streaming giant is beginning to work toward sustained profitability, which is why analysts expect Netflix to increase its earnings by 56% this year.

As for valuation, Apple trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 times expected earnings, or a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 2.17 times analysts' five-year earnings growth expectations. That is lower than Netflix's PEG ratio of 2.94.

Netflix stock sports a high forward P/E of 70, so it will have to continue posting high growth rates in revenue and earnings to justify this valuation level, but it should be up to the task. Netflix has a long growth runway, particularly across international markets. Its brand awareness overseas is still relatively low for what Americans consider a must-have subscription for home entertainment. Growth overseas will be important for Netflix in the near term, given that there could be limited pricing power to pad revenue growth in the U.S. with so many competitors emerging.

Investors who like dividends and have lower risk tolerance for high P/E stocks may favor Apple. But if I were making the choice today, I would invest in the stock with the higher headroom to increase in value.

7,2 Challenges Facing Apple TV+,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCVsUcte_GIA5R7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411756/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f20%2f2-challenges-facing-apple-tv.aspx/RK=2/RS=iL06PaxVyvkCgGMY7azwZhY0ArU-,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched Apple TV+ about six months ago with a generous promotion: buy an Apple device and get a free year of the service. The standard price is $4.99 per month.

Despite the offer -- and selling tens of millions of devices over the last six months -- just 10 million people have signed up for Apple TV+ since its launch, according to a report from Bloomberg. Just half of those sign-ups actively use the service.

To put that in perspective, Disney (NYSE:DIS) had 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ on launch day (including presales and free trials), and reported 54.5 million subscribers as of the beginning of May.

Apple's paltry numbers highlight two challenges facing the fledgling streaming service. First, it doesn't have content that drives mass audiences to sign up. There's nothing on Apple TV+ that screams, ""You gotta see this!""

Second, Apple's content library is too thin to retain the subscribers it has. Even if a subscriber likes a series, there's not much else for them to watch after they've finished it.

Bulking up the content library

Apple is reportedly looking to build up its content library with some older films and television series. Apple TV+ has been exclusively original content up until this point. There's value in that strategy: Originals are one of the main reasons people sign up for new streaming services.

But Apple needs to bulk up the library to get people to remain engaged with its service after they finish watching whatever series got them to sign up in the first place. There's a reason Disney moved all 30 seasons of The Simpsons into Disney+; it's a big, time-consuming, popular, and rewatchable piece of content.

Some of the most popular content on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in terms of time spent watching are old licensed series. And as many media companies move to take back the streaming licenses on some of their most popular old shows, companies like Netflix are forced to pay extremely high prices for the few popular shows left available to license. For example, it reportedly bought the rights to Seinfeld for over $500 million.

So, it's clear why Apple might've initially balked at the idea of licensing old shows: It can be really expensive. Apple thought it would be more efficient to invest exclusively in originals. To be fair, Netflix touts its originals as its most efficient content in terms of cost per hour of viewing. But the success of Disney+, Netflix, and others shows there's still value in owning a sizable catalog of old licensed series and films.

Moreover, circumstances have changed recently. The spread of COVID-19 has shut down film and television production for the time being. That will likely cause delays for Apple TV+ originals set to come out later this year and early 2021. With fewer new originals coming down the pipeline, and free trials set to start expiring, the need for additional content is even more acute now.

Finding an original that makes people sign up

Apple is still searching for an original series that draws in new subscribers. It's important to note, though, that it might not be the quality of Apple's original efforts that's to blame. A big piece of making something popular is marketing. It doesn't matter how good a series is if only a few people have heard of it.

Netflix notably stepped up its marketing spend in 2018 in order to support its massive slate of original content. It's seen some good returns on that spend, seeing growing interest in its originals as other media companies pull back their licensed content. Netflix spent $2.65 billion on marketing last year, up from $1.28 billion in 2017. And it notably has access to the best billboard money can't buy -- the Netflix home screen.

Apple hasn't spent a lot on marketing Apple TV+ originals. It made a big push ahead of its launch, but it's been relatively quiet since. Apple may be saving its marketing budget for the next iPhone launch and the period when customers start lapping their free trial period. With many competitors in the space, it could take a lot of marketing spend to get customers interested in Apple TV+'s series.

That said, it's important to solve its retention problem first. What's the point of spending $100 million on a big-budget original series that draws in millions of viewers just to see them leave in a couple months after the series ends its run? A back catalog of popular content with lots of episodes that can fill in the gaps between series premieres could be a very valuable addition."
8,"Apple to Require Temperature Checks, Masks as It Opens More Stores",https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCVsUcte_GIA5x7QtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByN3UwbTk1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM5BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411756/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2fapple-to-require-temperature-checks-masks-as-it-op.aspx/RK=2/RS=eY3cIHiuNxdjad8k43bKSjpLCvY-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reopens stores around the world it's laying out its policies to keep customers safe, including social distancing, temperature checks, and mandatory face coverings.

In a blog post over the weekend, Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's head of retail, said that, in addition to focusing on limited occupancies in its stores, it is requiring all customers and employees to wear face coverings and undergo temperature checks. The tech stock said it will supply face masks for customers if they don't have one.

""Temperature checks will be conducted at the door, and posted health questions will screen for those with symptoms — like cough or fever — or who have had recent exposure to someone infected with COVID‑19,"" wrote O'Brien in the blog post. ""Throughout the day, we're conducting enhanced deep cleanings that place special emphasis on all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas.""

O'Brien said Apple has renewed its focus on one-on-one service at the Genius Bar and throughout its stores. It's also offering curbside pickup and drop off at many of its locations. Close to 100 Apple stores already have reopened their doors around the world, and Apple plans on reopening around 25 stores in the U.S. this week, although which locations reopen will be based on available data. ""These are not decisions we rush into — and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,"" said O'Brien."

While the iPhone maker is still mainly focused on original programming for Apple TV+, Apple realizes it needs to offer a variety of content to take on the streaming leaders, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter.

Apple TV+ has around 30 original shows and movies on its platform, which costs $4.99 a month. Compare this to Netflix, which has thousands of pieces of content users can stream, although Netflix does charge more, coming in at $8.99 a month for its cheapest package.

The move may be necessary for Apple. The sources told Bloomberg that about 10 million people have become customers of Apple TV+ as of February, but only around 5 million use it actively. That's amid the COVID-19 pandemic where shelter in place rules have driven demand for streaming content. With millions of people turning to streaming platforms to kill boredom during the pandemic, Apple is realizing it needs more content to keep users engaged. Apple is also seeing an uptick in usage and has taken steps to make its service more desirable during the pandemic. Last month, it started letting users watch certain shows for free."

The film, which Apple paid $70 million for streaming rights to the film for fifteen years, CNBC reports. The film, which Hanks wrote and Sony (NYSE:SNE)produced, cost around $50 million to make, according to the CNBC report.

Greyhound is the latest movie to land on the list of films that were scheduled to debut in movie theaters but were switched to a digital format as theaters across the world remain shutdown. Trolls World Tour, Scoob, and My Spy are just a few examples. Sony is retaining the Chinese rights to the film with the aim of releasing it in theaters, notes CNBC.

Winning the bidding war for the rights to Greyhound is a win for Apple TV+, which has been largely focusing on original content since it launched in November. With production halted on sets, and with people watching more content at home, the tech stock has had to look elsewhere to increase the amount it offers on its platform.

Apple also started buying off-the-air TV shows and older movies this week to augment its service, Bloomberg reports. As it stands Apple TV+ has about 30 original shows and movies on its platform. Netflix, on-the-other-hand, has thousands of pieces of content."

Considering the sheer size of Rogan's following, the pact has the potential to transform the economics of the podcasting ecosystem, as Spotify is reportedly paying over $100 million as part of the exclusive licensing agreement.

Apple isn't going to sit still while Spotify tries to take a bite out of its podcasting business.

Playing podcast defense

Bloomberg reports that Apple is preparing to boost its investments in original podcast content, purchasing shows that would become exclusive to its platforms. The Mac maker is currently in the market for podcasts related to existing movies and shows on Apple TV+, as well as other series that could potentially be repurposed for video content in the future, according to the report.

The Cupertino tech juggernaut is trying to recruit an executive to lead the initiative. They would report to Apple's podcasting chief, Ben Cave. Funding exclusive originals is a time-tested strategy for streaming services to attract subscribers, and Bloomberg had previously reported last summer that Apple was exploring such a move. Trying to tie podcasts in with Apple TV+ content is a recent twist that could cross-promote the video-streaming service.

While Spotify has been spending lavishly, Apple has yet to open its pocketbook to cut any massive checks. The Swedish paid music streaming leader has already spent an estimated $700 million combined to buy Parcast, Gimlet, Anchor, The Ringer, and The Joe Rogan Experience exclusivity. That's all despite the fact that Apple had $83 billion in net cash at the end of last quarter, compared to the $2 billion in total cash that Spotify had.

Much like in music streaming, Apple is eschewing ads while Spotify is embracing them. Apple is reportedly asking podcast creators to exclude advertisements from shows, while Spotify recently introduced Streaming Ad Insertion technology that dynamically incorporates and targets ads within podcasts.

The news comes as Apple is also reportedly planning to add licensed content to Apple TV+ in an effort to quickly build out the service's catalog, which has consisted entirely of exclusive shows and movies thus far.

The two companies have different approaches to monetization. While podcasts are generally free, Spotify's big push into podcasts has helped boost conversion rates of free users to paid subscribers. Apple's angle appears to be pushing Apple TV+ subscriptions, which it's giving out for free (bundled with hardware purchases) in part due to a dearth of content."

The coronavirus stock market rally powered ahead last week, with the Nasdaq composite nearing all-time highs. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are all near buy points.

None of these stocks seem particularly eager to break out, despite a strong week for the coronavirus market rally. Apple stock and Google stock both edged past buy points last week, but never closed above them. Tesla stock and AMD stock hit aggressive entries, but then backed off slightly. Microsoft stock barely moved last week.

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide have reached 5.49 million. Covid-19 deaths are above 346,000.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. are at 1.68 million, with deaths topping 99,000.

A big question is whether states reopening economies will push up coronavirus cases. So far that hasn't happened, though there would be lag. Most of the reopening moves are incremental, while mask wearing and other social-distancing efforts, along with spring-summer weather may help suppress transmission rates.

If new cases, hospitalizations and deaths trend lower, states will be able to further reopen, providing a bigger lift to the economy and coronavirus stock market rally. If Covid-19 trends worsen, states may keep a relatively tight lid on activity.

Memorial Day weekend is a big test, with many people in crowds or traveling in greater numbers than at any point since the coronavirus crisis hit the U.S.

The silver bullet for the coronavirus pandemic and an economic recovery is a vaccine. There are hopeful signs for some vaccine candidates, with buzz that some may be ready later this year. But everything has to go right. A coronavirus vaccine, especially for the broad public, may not be ready until late 2021 or beyond.

The U.S. is barring entry of all foreigners who've been in Brazil within the prior 14 days, the White House said Sunday.

Brazil has now passed Russia for the second-most coronavirus cases, with both countries continuing add a large number of new infections every day. Coronavirus testing is very low in Brazil. Several other Latin American countries, India and much of the Middle East are showing big increases in Covid-19 cases.

Stock Market Update: The Bull Rages To Higher Ground

Coronavirus Stock Market Rally

The coronavirus stock market rally quietly had another strong week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 3.3%, the S&P 500 index 3.2% and the Nasdaq composite 3.4%. The Nasdaq composite is getting close to record highs, while the S&P 500 index is close to its 200-day line. The 50-day moving averages for the Dow and S&P 500 have now turned up.

Apple stock rose 3.6% last week, outpacing the major indexes. Microsoft nudged up just 0.2%. Both AAPL stock and MSFT stock are members of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.

Among the best ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rose 3.5%, with MSFT stock as the No. 1 holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) surged 5.2%. AMD and Nvdia stock are key components.

Recent breakouts have continued to shine, including Nvidia stock, Twilio (TWLO), Chipotle (CMG) and Datadog (DDOG).

But while Facebook (FB) and ASML (ASML) powered higher last week, the number of new breakouts has dwindled. That's especially surprising. The S&P 500 confirmed the coronavirus stock market rally on April 2, with the Nasdaq following through on April 6. The powerful rally has propelled dozens of growth stocks past buy points and hasn't paused for any significant length of time for those leaders to set up new bases.

That's good news for investors who jumped into early breakouts, but the pickings are slimmer now.

A key reason to investors to start when there's a follow-through day is because the big winners of a stock market rally often break out in those first few weeks. Another reason is that breakouts can be harder to find after several weeks of a market rally.

Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

Apple Stock

Apple stock rose 3.6% to 318.89 last week. That's just below a 319.79 buy point, though AAPL stock did hit 320.89 intraday Thursday. On a daily chart, 319.79 an alternate entry after clearing a cup-with-handle buy point of 288.35 at the end of April. On a weekly chart, that earlier handle didn't appear, so 319.79 is a conventional cup-with-handle buy point for AAPL stock.

The relative strength line for Apple stock is right at record highs. The RS line, the blue line in the charts below, reflects a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. It's a good way to spot leading stocks in good markets or bad.

AAPL stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 93.

Microsoft Stock

Microsoft stock rose just 0.2% to 183.51 last week. That's still in buy range from a 180.10 handle entry on what's either a cup or double-bottom pattern. So investors could buy MSFT stock right here. But shares clearly seem to hitting some resistance. In fact, Microsoft stock now has a three-weeks-tight formation.

A three-weeks-tight is when a stock breaks out, advances some distance, then trades tightly for a few weeks. The stock must have weekly closes within 1%-1.5% of the prior week for two straight weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the three-weeks-tight. That gives a 187.61 entry in this case.

Typically, a three-weeks-tight is a place for existing investors to add a few more shares. But given that MSFT stock is still in the broader base, one could treat this three-weeks-tight as another handle, offering a chance to start a new position.

The RS line has drifted lower for the past couple of weeks as Microsoft stock consolidates. But moved higher during the market crash and the coronavirus stock market rally.

Microsoft was Thursday's IBD Stock Of The Day.

MSFT stock has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.

Google Stock

Google stock climbed 2.9% last week to 1,413.24, hitting 1,147 shortly before Friday's close. GOOGL stock has a 1,415.63 cup-with-handle buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.

The RS for Google stock is right at highs, with solid gains since earnings on April 28. But Google stock has not been a big winner over the past few years.

GOOGL stock was Friday's IBD Stock Of The Day.

Google stock has a 96 Composite Rating.

Tesla Stock

Tesla stock rose 2.2% to 816.88 last week. TSLA stock, which has been very volatile in 2020, has been trading very tightly in the past few weeks. Another positive sign is that the RS line for Tesla stock is right at record highs.

Tesla stock has a handle buy point of 869.92. On Thursday, shares appeared to nudge past a downward-sloping trend line, but then fell slightly Friday. Investors probably should wait for Tesla stock to clear at least 843.39 (just above the May 12 peak) or the traditional handle entry of 869.92.

There is a wedge-like feel to the TSLA handle, so a short-term pullback could be healthy, whether to the 21-day moving average, below the May 13 low or even to near the May 1 low of 683.04. That would shake out some weak holders.

But Tesla stock is going to do what it's going to do.

TSLA stock has a 97 Composite Rating.

Meanwhile, Tesla's business is far more uncertain than the other companies on the list. A severe recession and high-income people often working from home isn't a great recipe for luxury auto demand, while Tesla is losing market share in Europe, where electric vehicle competition is expanding rapidly.

AMD Stock

AMD stock rose 1.8% to 55.17 last week, moving toward a 58.73 cup-with-handle buy point. Like Tesla stock, AMD ticked past a short trend line early entry but backed off. Investors should probably wait to clear Tuesday's peak of 56.98 or simply wait for a traditional breakout.

After a six-month run to mid-April, the RS line for AMD stock has backed off, but not much.

The real concern with AMD stock isn't its performance vs. the broader stock market rally but relative to other data-center chip stocks. Nvidia stock, Inphi (IPHI) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) all have broken out and risen rapidly while AMD moves sideways.

AMD stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating.

You might recall that Apple originally bundled original content with Apple Music, a music-streaming service. One of the early projects was a show that would be based on Dr. Dre, who briefly served as an Apple executive after the company bought Beats. Once upon a time, services chief Eddy Cue even explicitly said that Apple was not interested in creating TV shows or competing with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

Not only has Apple proceeded to do precisely those things, the company may be preparing to make yet another massive pivot in video streaming.

Apple needs quantity now

Apple TV+ thus far has only featured exclusive content that Apple has spent years and billions of dollars developing. But building up a catalog of original content takes a long time, and the service's offerings are fairly sparse compared to the competition. Disney (NYSE:DIS) has literal decades' worth of shows and movies that are included in Disney+, which launched around the same time as Apple TV+ last year.

It already seemed that the iPhone maker recognized that Apple TV+ was not particularly competitive, which is why it's been giving away a free year of service bundled with certain hardware purchases. Apple TV+ normally costs $5 per month, but even that's a tough sell compared to Disney+'s price of $7 per month given how much more you get from the latter platform.

In an effort to compensate for the lack of quantity, Apple is reportedly acquiring older licensed content to include in Apple TV+, according to AdAge and Bloomberg. Cue had said last year that the focus would initially be on quality over quantity, but quality alone might not be enough to compete in the video-streaming wars, even with A-list talent like Chris Evans or Jennifer Aniston.

We're not talking about any major blockbuster franchises, according to the report. Cultural mainstays like Friends or The Office can fetch licensing fees in the hundreds of millions. Streaming leader Netflix initially started off with licensed content before expanding into original content early on.

A changing landscape

More broadly, there has been a shift in the streaming landscape, as just about every media company is pulling back on licensing content to third-party services in order to keep those shows and movies exclusive to their own streaming platforms that have either already launched or are about to debut.

Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Peacock service launches broadly this summer, which will eventually be the exclusive streaming home to NBC shows like The Office once existing licensing agreements expire. Despite using an ad-free model, Disney+ ran a one-time promotion at launch for Lionsgate's Starz as a concession in order to get the streaming rights back for its own movies, most notably Star Wars installments.

Ever since Apple emerged as a prominent buyer in Hollywood in recent years, the price for original content has been climbing higher. With the market for licensed content contracting, Apple might be able to score more stuff to watch for reasonable licensing fees. Will it be enough to get people to actually pay for Apple TV+ out of pocket?"
15,Amazon Leapfrogs Apple in Fortune 500,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCZvUctePw8AkxbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjR0MTVzBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM3BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411759/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f20%2famazon-leapfrogs-apple-in-fortune-500.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=NHrW_FHsBMt7XxNi5ptEA8Kg6SQ-,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"Fortune released its annual Fortune 500 rankings this week, listing the largest companies by revenue generated last year. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was able to pull off a major coup: The e-commerce behemoth has leapfrogged Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the No. 2 company behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which ranked No. 1 for the eighth consecutive year.

Here's how the distinguished list changed for 2020.

Amazon won't overtake Walmart anytime soon

As the biggest retailer on Earth, Walmart's revenue of $524 billion remains comfortably ahead of any other company. Amazon's top line grew by 21% in 2019 to reach $281 billion, climbing the highest it's ever been in the rankings. Keep in mind that the list is based on 2019 revenue -- i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide. The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the shift to e-commerce as people shop from the safety of their homes, and Amazon has seen a spike in demand as a result.

Meanwhile, Apple's revenue has seemingly plateaued as iPhone sales slow and the company looks to other segments like services and wearables to pick up the slack. But considering the sheer size of the iPhone business, it takes a lot to compensate for iPhone declines. The Cupertino tech giant's revenue fell a modest 2% last year to $260 billion, with its ranking slipping to No. 4.

Here's how the top five companies have changed over the past several years.

Rank 2018 2019 2020 1 Walmart Walmart Walmart 2 ExxonMobil ExxonMobil Amazon 3 Berkshire Hathaway Apple ExxonMobil 4 Apple Berkshire Hathaway Apple 5 UnitedHealth Amazon CVS Health

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was all the way down at No. 21 with $126 billion, even as the enterprise software juggernaut boasts the highest market cap ($1.4 trillion) because investors are pricing in higher growth expectations from its booming cloud business. The most valuable companies in the Fortune 500 now fetch a combined market valuation of $4.6 trillion. In terms of market cap, Apple's is just under $1.4 trillion and Amazon is worth a little over $1.2 trillion.

With the annual reshuffling, Apple CEO Tim Cook's preferred (and frustrating) way of disclosing the size of the wearables business is rendered irrelevant. Cook likes to compare the wearables business to the list, even though all the thresholds and rankings change every year. For example, the most recent such comparison was that Apple's wearables business was the size of a Fortune 150 company, translating into $20.8 billion in revenue based on last year's rankings. No. 150 this year is Rite Aid, with $21.7 billion."
16,Is Apple Stock a Buy?,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCZvUctePw8AlRbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411759/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f23%2fis-apple-stock-a-buy.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=jI0XP_iP_Ey6T6GQ5Xuf994MmAI-,2020-05-23 00:00:00,"Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest earnings report was upbeat about the future, despite softness in demand for iPhones and wearables. Apple reached a new record for active users across its iDevices and continues to see new users for premium services, such as Apple TV+, Arcade, and News+.

The stock has returned market-crushing returns for investors over the last decade, but the near term will be challenging. Growth in its largest sales category, the iPhone, has been slowing. This trend will worsen in the near term, especially as consumer spending takes a hit with higher unemployment as a result of COVID-19.

I own shares of Apple and believe the business will continue to grow over time. But is this the right time to buy the stock? To answer this question, we'll review a few reasons to wait, along with a few reasons to take the plunge.

Reasons not to buy

A weak outlook for iPhone sales is one reason to pass on Apple stock for now, especially since the stock has already rebounded off recent lows and sits at a high valuation relative to underlying growth.

During the last conference call, management didn't offer guidance but did state that sales of iPhone and wearables (e.g. Apple Watch) will worsen through June. The iPhone comprised half of Apple's total revenue in its most recent quarter.

Bullish investors point to the growth of the services business, but it currently makes up only 23% of Apple's revenue, so it's not enough to completely offset potential softness in iPhone sales.

Some investors may be looking ahead to the next upgrade cycle, when Apple is expected to announce the new 5G-enabled iPhone. But there is always the possibility that the new iPhone could be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, or that the upgrade cycle may not be as strong as expected.

However, Apple disclosed on its last earnings call that its supply chains were back up and running, so it seems the new iPhone is on schedule for launch in the fall.

The faster connection speeds of a 5G iPhone could cause a huge upgrade cycle over the next few years. But assuming the new iPhone does release as expected this fall, it's unclear what the demand will look like, especially since more than 20 million Americans just lost their jobs in April, the largest decline ever recorded in a single month.

For what it's worth, the consensus analyst estimate currently expects Apple to report 1% growth in revenue and low-single-digit growth in earnings in fiscal 2020 (which ends in September). That is very low growth for a stock that is trading at 25 times forward earnings estimates.

Reasons to buy

Apple stock may have limited upside in the near term, given its slowing growth and high valuation. But investors who are looking to start a new position in one of the top brands in the world could do so for a few reasons.

Apple is a solid business, with a mountain of cash to invest in new products and services to drive growth over the long term. It is continuing to invest in new products and has pledged to invest $350 billion in the U.S. economy over the next five years. I'm certainly not selling my shares, even if Apple reports a decrease in revenue and earnings for the full fiscal year. I'm more interested in where Apple will be in 10 years.

No one knows exactly what the demand curve will be for a 5G iPhone, but over the next decade, 5G connection speeds will bring several benefits.

One area to watch is mobile gaming -- the fastest-growing market in the video game industry. Faster connection speeds will make these apps run at much higher performance overall, especially when connecting multiple players in a competitive game at the same time. This will make iPhones and iPads much more formidable gaming platforms.

Apple is continuing to look for acquisitions to expand its capabilities. It just acquired NextVR, a provider of sports and other content for virtual reality products. The deal will only fuel recent rumors that Apple may release a new device with virtual reality or augmented reality technology, such as smart glasses, in the next few years.

Apple is a safe stock to buy, but it's no bargain

Apple will remain a good investment for the long haul. Its installed base of active devices continues to grow, although slowly. In January, Apple reported an installed base of more than 1.5 billion active devices, up 100 million over the preceding 12 months. The growing installed base should lead to a more valuable business over time, which should translate to a rising stock price.

But investors thinking of buying this FAANG stock should keep in mind the near-term risk of weak demand for the iPhone, coupled with the stock's relatively high forward P/E ratio of 25. That combination is not a recipe for a rising stock price from the current high.

New investors who love Apple and want skin in the game could start small and gradually add shares over time, which is a perfectly reasonable way to invest in businesses you like. This is the way I invest when I love a company, but not the stock's valuation."

(NASDAQ: AAPL) is reopening more than 25 stores in the United States, moving towards a gradual resumption of its retail business worldwide.

What Happened

In a letter to customers released Sunday, Apple’s head of retail, Deirdre O’Brien, announced that the iPhone maker had reopened 100 of its stores globally. The first was in Greater China in February, and last month Apple extended the reopening to other countries beginning with South Korea.

The Cupertino-based tech giant now plans to restart business in more than 25 stores in the U.S. after the initial five stores had been back to business last week. These stores have instituted temperature checks and require customers and employees to wear face masks.

O’Brien acknowledged, “The response to COVID‑19 is still ongoing, and we recognize that the road back will have its twists and turns.”

Why It Matters

Apple has 510 stores around the world, 271 of which are in the United States. Forty-two stores have resumed business in China. Ten Italian stores will open their doors this week.

According to Apple, it is using the same health and safety strategies it used in China in its global reopenings.

The stores will limit occupancy, and face masks will be provided to those customers who do not bring their own. Apple will also “deep clean” the stores throughout the day.

Limitations like curb-side pick up and drop off may be in place at many stores. Pick-up will be available for users who purchase online, in addition to home delivery.

Direct Sales, including those at Apple’s retail stores, online stores, and corporate sales amounted to 31% of the company’s $260 billion revenue in 2019, reported Reuters.

Price Action

On Friday, Apple shares closed 0.59% lower at $307.71."
18,Dow Jones News: Microsoft Partners With FedEx; Apple Stock Rises as Stores Slowly Reopen,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCZvUctePw8AmRbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBzdmVvZmlwBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxMAR2dGlkAwRzZWMDc3I-/RV=2/RE=1590411759/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2fdow-jones-news-microsoft-partners-with-fedex-apple.aspx/RK=2/RS=6elYgmzwML7NkUnaN8utF9DJokI-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had surged 3.4% by 12:50 p.m. EDT Monday. The rally was likely driven by two pieces of news. First, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in an interview on 60 Minutes that the Fed was ""not out of ammunition by a long shot"" as it combats the negative impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Second, an early-stage vaccine trial showed positive results.

Tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market on Monday, although both stocks still managed to rise. Microsoft announced a collaboration with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to offer logistics solutions, and Apple plans to open more of its U.S. stores this week.

Microsoft cloud powers FedEx collaboration

FedEx is not a huge fan of e-commerce giant Amazon.com. A Bloomberg article earlier this year described the company as ""a kind of anti-Amazon ally for big-box retailers."" FedEx founder Fred Smith expects the company's strategy, which involves strengthening relationships with brick-and-mortar retailers, to allow it to overtake rival UPS within the next few years.

FedEx will get some help from a logical source, given its anti-Amazon slant. On Monday, FedEx and Microsoft announced a multi-year collaboration that will combine FedEx's logistics capabilities with Microsoft's cloud technology. Joint offerings will be developed for customers using Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365, with the goal being to ""reinvent the most critical aspects of the commerce experience and enable businesses to better compete in today's increasingly digital landscape.""

The first solution to emerge from this partnership is FedEx Surround, which aims to use data and near-real-time analytics to improve supply chain visibility. The solution is particularly well suited for businesses that depend on time-sensitive deliveries. Two examples given in the announcement: ""...a hospital may urgently need a package to help save a life, or a part may need rapid transport to a manufacturing facility to avoid an operational shutdown.""

Microsoft has grown its Azure cloud infrastructure business rapidly in recent years, putting it behind only Amazon Web Services in terms of market share. Microsoft's biggest advantage may be that it's not Amazon. A company like FedEx, which is increasingly competing with Amazon as the e-commerce giant builds out its own logistics capabilities, certainly isn't going to turn to Amazon for cloud computing capabilities if it has an alternative option.

Shares of Microsoft were up just 1.1% by early Monday afternoon, trailing the broader market substantially. However, the stock has performed well in recent weeks, and it's close to surpassing its 52-week high.

Apple slowly opens stores

With the economy being reopened in many U.S. states, Apple is slowly reopening its retail stores to the public. The tech giant plans to open more than 25 of its stores in the U.S. this week, adding to stores it has already reopened around the world. Around 20% of its global retail stores have been reopened at this point, including five in the U.S. that were opened last week.

While Apple doesn't disclose how much revenue it derives from its stores alone, it does disclose how much revenue it generates from selling products directly to its customers. Direct sales channels include Apple's retail stores, e-commerce, and its direct sales force. In fiscal 2019, 31% of Apple's revenue came from direct sales channels.

The closing of many retail stores across the U.S. due to the pandemic has greatly impacted demand for Apple's products. Last week, data from KeyBanc Capital Markets indicated that U.S. iPhone sales tumbled 77% in April compared to the prior-year period. Sales were down 56% from March.

As retail stores reopen, Apple should see a rebound in demand. However, with the U.S. economy deeply depressed and unlikely to fully recover anytime soon, demand for Apple's pricey gadgets may remain soft for quite some time. Shares of Apple were up 2.3% by early Monday afternoon."
19,This Apple Supplier Could Turn Out to Be a Top 5G Play,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYAwjbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByb2lvbXVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2fapple-supplier-could-be-a-top-5g-play-cirrus.aspx/RK=2/RS=251tLTaVHXmSi1bU1DHujg1hMAc-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS) crushed Wall Street's expectations with a terrific fiscal 2020 fourth-quarter report earlier this month. The chipmaker's revenue and earnings increased substantially during the quarter that ended in March, which is impressive considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smartphone markets across the globe.

Cirrus supplies audio chips to smartphone companies. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is its largest customer, accounting for 75% of the total revenue last quarter, followed by an Android smartphone maker that supplies another 10%. Such a heavy reliance on smartphones should have ideally wrecked the chipmaker's quarterly performance as shipments plunged 11.7% during the first quarter of the year, according to IDC.

However, that didn't happen, and Cirrus beat the coronavirus blues. Let's see how.

What's working for Cirrus Logic

Cirrus Logic's fourth-quarter revenue jumped 16% annually to $279.3 million, thanks to a combination of content gains in smartphones and an increase in unit volumes. For the full year, Cirrus recorded 8% revenue growth.

Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings shot up to $0.68 per share from $0.37 in the prior-year period. A favorable product mix, supply chain improvements, and cost reductions led to a slight improvement in Cirrus's non-GAAP gross margin during the quarter and led to earnings growth.

Don't be disappointed by the guidance

The guidance, however, turned out to be slightly disappointing. Cirrus expects $200 million to $250 million in revenue this quarter, a 6% decline at the mid-point of its guidance range. The company blames the annual revenue decline on a drop in shipment volumes and lower smart codec content in Android smartphones.

But investors should note that the June quarter is usually a slow one for Cirrus. That's because Apple starts winding down the production of older generation iPhones during the quarter in preparation for new launches that typically happen in September. Cirrus's revenue was down as well by an identical margin in the June 2019 quarter for a similar reason, indicating that COVID-19 isn't going to have much of a negative impact on the business.

The trial production of new iPhones will reportedly begin in the month of June, which means that mass production will only happen during the September quarter. Then again, supply-chain rumors indicate that the novel coronavirus pandemic could force Apple to delay the launch of its next-generation iPhones by a month.

So, Cirrus's growth will only get back on track in the second half of the year when iPhone production begins.

Sitting on a big opportunity

The novel coronavirus outbreak isn't great news for the smartphone industry. Supply-chain disruptions and a potential demand weakness -- thanks to the economic fallout of COVID-19 -- are expected to dent shipments this year. Smartphone unit shipments were originally expected to hit 1.4 billion units this year, according to third-party estimates. The projection has now been whittled down to 1.34 billion units in light of the pandemic.

The good part is that Cirrus is well-equipped to handle this headwind. On its latest earnings conference call, Cirrus management pointed out that the company has no debt and is sitting on $600 million in cash. As a result, it plans to ""invest through the downturn"" to branch into new audio applications.

This should help Cirrus set itself up for the 5G smartphone revolution that has already begun. Strategy Analytics reports that 5G smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2020 came in at 24.1 million units. By comparison, 18.7 million 5G smartphones were shipped last year.

The spurt in 5G smartphones last quarter was driven by the launch of new devices from the likes of Samsung, Huawei, and other Chinese vendors. Apple could join the fray later this year as it is expected to launch multiple 5G models in 2020, giving Cirrus Logic a nice shot in the arm in the back half of the year

This is why now looks like a good time to go long Cirrus stock. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27 is much lower than the 2019 multiple of 42, making Cirrus Logic an ideal semiconductor pick to take advantage of 5G smartphones."
20,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in May,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYAxDbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2f3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-may.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=uUCAJCyIUDOZT5z9E7lBVhbTbE8-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"Dividend investing is a good way to beat the market through the power of compounding. And dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform during recessions due to their resilient, cash-generating business models. That's great news for investors looking to scoop up stocks during the pandemic.

Despite the uncertainty in the market, these three dividend-paying tech stocks are good buys in May. The first pick, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is a safe, high-yielding bet on the telecommunication sector, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investments in the fast-growing software and consumer hardware industries. All three companies have grown their payouts for over seven years straight. And they are set to outperform the market because of their compelling long-term growth drivers.

1. Verizon: Current yield of 4.5%

Verizon Communications is a high-yield tech stock set to outperform the market. Its telecommunications business is resilient to coronavirus-related challenges in the near term and stands to benefit from massive long-term trends such as the rollout of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Its top line held up well in the first quarter, which felt the early brunt of the pandemic. Total revenue fell slightly -- down 1.6% year over year to $31.6 billion, while adjusted EBITDA was down 0.1% to $11.9 billion. The company saw a surge in data usage related to gaming and collaboration tools as lockdowns boosted demand for mobile entertainment and work-from-home opportunities.

Verizon also has an excellent opportunity in the rollout of the Internet of Things, which will see millions of devices ranging from microwaves to industrial machinery brought online. The 5G market is estimated to be worth $5.5 billion in 2020 and grow at a compound annual rate of over 120% through 2026. The company is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity thanks to its rapidly expanding 5G network in the U.S.

Verizon stock yields 4.5% as of this writing, and it has increased its payout for 13 years running. The company generated earnings per share of $4.65 in 2019 while paying out $2.435 per share, giving it a sustainable payout ratio of around 52%.

2. Apple: Current yield of 1.1%

Apple is a fairly new candidate for income investors, initiating a steady payout seven years ago and raising it annually since then. But with a payout ratio of just 25%, coupled with $90 billion of cash and over $75 billion of share repurchases in just the past year, the company is set to return massive value to shareholders for the foreseeable future.

The stock has held up well in the face of the coronavirus with shares up 5% year to date compared to an 11% decline for the S&P 500. And Apple is set to continue outperforming the market thanks to its rapidly growing services segment, as well as its wearables, home, and accessories business. These two divisions will make up for slowing iPhone sales and ensure dividend sustainability for years to come.

Apple's total revenue rose slightly in the fiscal 2020 second quarter, which ended on March 28. The company reported $58.3 billion in total net sales, up 0.5% from the prior-year period. The quarter experienced slowing consumer hardware sales, which includes the iPhone, Mac, and iPad. However, Apple's services, along with its wearables, home, and accessories business, showed a different trend, with the two growing 16.6% and 22.4%, respectively.

Those two segments will be Apple's main growth drivers going forward. And they will help the company sustain its dividend over the long term. They make up an increasing portion of the top line, now representing 33.7% of sales, up from 28.6% in the year-ago quarter.

3. Microsoft: Current yield of 1.1%

With a market cap of nearly $1.4 trillion, you might assume Microsoft is done growing, but you would be wrong. This blue chip tech company is rapidly expanding its business through emerging industries like cloud computing, which is set to power its next leg of long-term growth. Add that to a sustainable dividend, and you've got a compelling stock to add to your portfolio.

Like other stocks on this list, Microsoft enjoys a business model that is resilient to the COVID-19 fallout. Revenue increased 14.6% year over year to $35.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on March 31. The stock has also outperformed the broad market with shares rising 16% year to date.

Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment is the company's fastest-growing business with revenue up 27.3% last quarter. The segment includes Microsoft's Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services, the current market leader in the industry. This is a business that is set to continue growing at a rapid rate due to a secular shift toward cloud computing in the global economy.

Microsoft has a dividend yield of 1.1% as of this writing. And the company paid $1.99 of dividends per share in the trailing 12-month period versus diluted earnings of $6.00 per share, giving it a low payout ratio of 33%. The company has grown the dividend for almost 15 years running."

FB Stock Enters Buy Zone

Like most stocks, Facebook dropped as the coronavirus took its toll in February. But FB stock has proved resilient. Just as quickly as it crashed in February, the social media giant rebounded off its March lows.

With its relative strength line jumping to a new 52-week high, Facebook punched through a 215.38 buy point in a cup with handle on Tuesday. Volume picked up, coming in 23% above average.

FB stock managed to keep spiking Wednesday, gapping up to a 6% gain in even stronger trade. As you like to see, it closed toward the top of its price range.

Facebook reported Q1 earnings on April 29, with EPS growth accelerating from 8% in Q4 to 101%. Analysts are looking for 51% growth in Q2.

Amazon, Alphabet, and Apple also rose Wednesday. Of the FAANG stock, only Netflix closed lower But the streaming giant found support at its 10-day line and remains near its all-time highs.

Along with Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, Facebook made IBD's latest list of new buys by the best funds. From February to April, 41 of these top funds invested approximately $1.3 billion in FB stock.

AAPL stock ($2.5 billion from 29 top funds), NFLX stock ($1.3 billion, 35 funds) and GOOGL stock ($1.1 billion, 31 funds) also joined the billion-dollar club.

Balancing Optimism With Caution

The technical rebound in Facebook and other FAANG stocks has been impressive and encouraging. But we're not necessarily out of the woods yet. Investors should keep in mind that V-shaped recoveries can work, but they can also be followed by another round of declines. For example, the stock market retreated in April 1930, following a rebound after the crash in October 1929.

No one knows if history will repeat itself or if this new rally will continue to reach new heights. That's why investors should remain both optimistic and cautious.

If this new uptrend takes hold after the severe coronavirus crash, you certainly want to ride this next bull cycle. But if we do encounter another downturn, you want to make sure you have defensive sell rules in place to protect your portfolio.

22,Here's Why You Might Not Want to Buy Stocks Right Now,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYAyDbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByc3RzMXFjBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM0BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f24%2fheres-why-you-might-not-want-to-buy-stocks-right-n.aspx/RK=2/RS=se77_baA0nWWnyulK9ysqfYf0nc-,2020-05-24 00:00:00,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a massive stock market sell-off in late February and March, many investors have bought stocks with the expectation that they'd make nice gains when the market rebounded. Sure enough, the stock market began to rebound in late March. The major market indices have regained much of their losses. Many individual stocks are even up year to date.

But is it now time to put further buying on pause? Here are three reasons why you might not want to buy stocks right now.

1. Valuations are frothy

There's a pretty solid argument to be made that the valuations of many stocks have gotten too frothy. This argument is especially compelling considering that the global economy could be facing its biggest challenges since the Great Depression.

Consider Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Shares of the tech giant are close to their all-time highs, but its business could very well be hit hard if the U.S. enters an especially nasty recession. And the prospects of such a recession seem likely.

You might say, ""But Apple is just one stock."" That's true, but it runs neck-and-neck as the largest member by market cap in both the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. As Apple goes, so goes the overall stock market to a great extent. More importantly, there are plenty of other stocks that have valuations at least as high as Apple's.

2. Q2 earnings will be worse than Q1

Many investors breathed a sigh of relief after the first-quarter earnings season. A lot of companies reported pretty good results in the quarter. But expect Q2 earnings results to be significantly worse than Q1 results.

For one thing, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will more heavily impact the second quarter than it impacted the first quarter. States have only recently begun to reopen after imposing stay-at-home orders. This means that at least half of the second quarter will reflect much lower overall economic activity than usual. By comparison, the first quarter included only a week or two of reduced economic activity.

Remember also that some companies benefited in the first quarter from consumers stocking up due to the coronavirus outbreak. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) enjoyed higher prescription volumes in Q1 as people shifted to 90-day prescriptions from shorter-duration prescriptions and filled maintenance medications early. The healthcare company also saw increased front-store sales as consumers stocked up on other products. However, CVS Health won't have those tailwinds in the second quarter.

3. Another wave of outbreaks could be on the way

Perhaps the most worrisome reason to stay away from stocks now is that another wave of coronavirus outbreaks could be on the way. And it could be even worse than the first round.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield has expressed concern that a second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak could be more challenging to the U.S. than the first one because it could coincide with flu season. Multiple waves of outbreaks are common with pandemics. The second round of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was worse than the first round.

Stock markets are heavily influenced by psychological factors. If investors are worried, they're likely to sell stocks in a panic. That's what happened earlier this year. It could easily happen again. The timing of the U.S. elections could also play a factor. Some could be motivated to play up the risks of a potential second COVID-19 wave to serve their political interests.

Also, many investors appear to be banking on quick success for COVID-19 vaccines in development. Should the most promising vaccine candidates stumble in clinical testing, anxiety levels could be even higher in the fall than they are now.

Then again...

Here's some good news: Most things we worry about don't end up happening. A Penn State study found that 91% of people's worries ended up being much ado about nothing. As for the remaining 9% of worries that did become reality, the outcome was better than people expected around one-third of the time.

Also, the stock market is forward-looking. Investors have largely factored in the potential for dismal Q2 results. It's no secret that another COVID-19 round could be on the way.

So should investors stay away from stocks or not? My advice is to take a long-term perspective. If you believe that a given stock's long-term prospects should enable it to grow significantly over the next five-to-10 years, don't be concerned about what might happen over the next few months.

Let's again use Apple as our example. The company's services businesses continue to grow and likely will continue to do so for years to come. Apple stands to benefit from its anticipated launches of iPhones that support high-speed 5G wireless networks. The stock might decline from its current levels this year, but it's a pretty good bet that Apple will be a lot higher 10 years from now than it is today.

I also recommend buying incrementally, perhaps once each month. You won't be able to time the market perfectly except by pure chance. Buy shares of your favorite stocks in incremental chunks over time.

But if you're still worried about the potential for another stock market downturn, you can always focus only on stocks that are likely to perform well regardless of what happens next with the COVID-19 pandemic or the global economy. I think Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a good example of such a stock.

Vertex markets the only drugs that treat the underlying cause of rare genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). It awaits European approval of its most powerful CF drug so far, Trikafta. The company is highly profitable. It has a huge cash stockpile. Its pipeline includes several promising candidates. And the biotech stock trades at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of only 0.58, a dirt cheap valuation assuming it comes anywhere close to hitting growth targets.

The bottom line is that you might not want to buy stocks right now, but there are ways to keep investing that will enable you to win over the long run regardless of what happens next."
23,"Apple Looking To Diversify Its Manufacturing Base, Will Make Headphones In Vietnam",https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYAyjbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBya2cwZmh2BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM1BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.benzinga.com%2fnews%2f20%2f05%2f16071474%2fapple-looking-to-diversify-its-manufacturing-base-will-make-headphones-in-vietnam/RK=2/RS=j2WKJfHDMmPVyEzlO4PoBHyyrdA-,None,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is looking to shift the manufacturing of its over-ear AirPods Studio headphones away from China.

What Happened

Apple will now make its new Studio range of headphones in Vietnam. This is the first time ever that the Cupertino-based tech giant has produced an entirely new product in Vietnam, according to 9to5Mac, an Apple news website.

Goertek Inc., an acoustics components firm and Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd, an Apple supplier, will assemble the headphones in Vietnam. Shipments to Apple would commence in June or July, with product release planned for late summer or early fall. Mass production is slated to begin mid-2020.

Why It Matters

The underlying reason for the shift of manufacturing to Vietnam is said to be “political and trade tensions” between the United States and China, reported 9to5Mac.

Some of the headphones will still be built by contract manufacturers in China, but even shifting some of the manufacturing away from the country is an indication of Apple’s intention of diversifying its manufacturing base.

Apple’s operations executives suggested in 2015 that the company move at least one product’s manufacturing to Vietnam. This would have given Apple a chance to begin the years-long process of training workers and creating a new group of component providers outside of China.

Apple has plans to move almost a fifth of its production capacity from China to India in order to take advantage of the Indian government’s new production-linked incentives scheme.

Price Action

Apple shares traded 1.40% higher at $314.54 in the after-hours session on Tuesday. The shares had closed the regular session 0.58% higher at $313.14."

What Happened

The changes to the facial recognition system are part of the iOS 13.5 update released Wednesday. A password or passcode field will be presented to masked users automatically after swiping up from the bottom of the lock screen.

After the iOS sysem is updated, Face ID will allow the same unlocking process for App Store, Apple Pay, iTunes, and other supported applications.

Before the update, the system would make more than one attempt to identify the user before displaying the passcode screen, thereby delaying device access, reported CNBC.

The new update also includes COVID-19 related digital contact tracing technology and exposure notification, which Apple developed in collaboration with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG).

Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, said on Twitter, “Technology can help health officials rapidly tell someone they may have been exposed to COVID-19. Today the Exposure Notification API we created with @Google is available to help public health agencies make their COVID-19 apps effective while protecting user privacy.”

Why It Matters

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has earlier issued guidelines on face coverings to control the spread of COVID-19, which encourages the use of masks.

Masks are compulsory in certain public and private environments, including on airplanes.

Face ID cannot recognize a masked user, necessitating the use of a password or a passcode, as many recent models of iPhones do not come with a fingerprint sensor, reported CNBC.

No changes to settings are required to use the new features in Face ID, users can simply download and apply the iOS update.

Apple Price Action

On Wednesday, Apple shares closed 1.94% higher at $319.23."
25,3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in May,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYAzjbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjR0MTVzBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM3BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2f3-dividend-paying-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-may.aspx/RK=2/RS=evCWUWsKU2hzemLVRajg8ugYXkU-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"Dividend investing is a good way to beat the market through the power of compounding. And dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform during recessions due to their resilient, cash-generating business models. That's great news for investors looking to scoop up stocks during the pandemic.

Despite the uncertainty in the market, these three dividend-paying tech stocks are good buys in May. The first pick, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is a safe, high-yielding bet on the telecommunication sector, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investments in the fast-growing software and consumer hardware industries. All three companies have grown their payouts for over seven years straight. And they are set to outperform the market because of their compelling long-term growth drivers.

1. Verizon: Current yield of 4.5%

Verizon Communications is a high-yield tech stock set to outperform the market. Its telecommunications business is resilient to coronavirus-related challenges in the near term and stands to benefit from massive long-term trends such as the rollout of 5G networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Its top line held up well in the first quarter, which felt the early brunt of the pandemic. Total revenue fell slightly -- down 1.6% year over year to $31.6 billion, while adjusted EBITDA was down 0.1% to $11.9 billion. The company saw a surge in data usage related to gaming and collaboration tools as lockdowns boosted demand for mobile entertainment and work-from-home opportunities.

Verizon also has an excellent opportunity in the rollout of the Internet of Things, which will see millions of devices ranging from microwaves to industrial machinery brought online. The 5G market is estimated to be worth $5.5 billion in 2020 and grow at a compound annual rate of over 120% through 2026. The company is well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity thanks to its rapidly expanding 5G network in the U.S.

Verizon stock yields 4.5% as of this writing, and it has increased its payout for 13 years running. The company generated earnings per share of $4.65 in 2019 while paying out $2.435 per share, giving it a sustainable payout ratio of around 52%.

2. Apple: Current yield of 1.1%

Apple is a fairly new candidate for income investors, initiating a steady payout seven years ago and raising it annually since then. But with a payout ratio of just 25%, coupled with $90 billion of cash and over $75 billion of share repurchases in just the past year, the company is set to return massive value to shareholders for the foreseeable future.

The stock has held up well in the face of the coronavirus with shares up 5% year to date compared to an 11% decline for the S&P 500. And Apple is set to continue outperforming the market thanks to its rapidly growing services segment, as well as its wearables, home, and accessories business. These two divisions will make up for slowing iPhone sales and ensure dividend sustainability for years to come.

Apple's total revenue rose slightly in the fiscal 2020 second quarter, which ended on March 28. The company reported $58.3 billion in total net sales, up 0.5% from the prior-year period. The quarter experienced slowing consumer hardware sales, which includes the iPhone, Mac, and iPad. However, Apple's services, along with its wearables, home, and accessories business, showed a different trend, with the two growing 16.6% and 22.4%, respectively.

Those two segments will be Apple's main growth drivers going forward. And they will help the company sustain its dividend over the long term. They make up an increasing portion of the top line, now representing 33.7% of sales, up from 28.6% in the year-ago quarter.

3. Microsoft: Current yield of 1.1%

With a market cap of nearly $1.4 trillion, you might assume Microsoft is done growing, but you would be wrong. This blue chip tech company is rapidly expanding its business through emerging industries like cloud computing, which is set to power its next leg of long-term growth. Add that to a sustainable dividend, and you've got a compelling stock to add to your portfolio.

Like other stocks on this list, Microsoft enjoys a business model that is resilient to the COVID-19 fallout. Revenue increased 14.6% year over year to $35.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on March 31. The stock has also outperformed the broad market with shares rising 16% year to date.

Microsoft's intelligent cloud segment is the company's fastest-growing business with revenue up 27.3% last quarter. The segment includes Microsoft's Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services, the current market leader in the industry. This is a business that is set to continue growing at a rapid rate due to a secular shift toward cloud computing in the global economy.

Microsoft has a dividend yield of 1.1% as of this writing. And the company paid $1.99 of dividends per share in the trailing 12-month period versus diluted earnings of $6.00 per share, giving it a low payout ratio of 33%. The company has grown the dividend for almost 15 years running."
26,"Dow Jones Heads Lower as IBM Cuts Jobs, Apple Stock Holds Its Ground on Podcast Plans",https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCd.UcteSEYA0DbQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411774/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f22%2fdow-jones-heads-lower-as-ibm-cuts-jobs-apple-stock.aspx/RK=2/RS=wkGk7t6PVVYQS.H66NVF2rvFnYQ-,2020-05-22 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down Friday morning ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. While many U.S. states are in the process of reopening after imposing lockdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the full scope of the economic impact is still unknown. The Dow was down about 0.45% at 11:40 a.m. EDT.

Many companies are turning to layoffs to adjust to depressed demand. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has joined that club, with reports indicating that the tech company has let potentially thousands of employees go. Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking steps to grow its services business amid a slump in iPhone demand. The company is reportedly looking to use exclusive podcasts to promote its Apple TV+ streaming service.

Layoffs hit IBM

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy, leading to more than 38 million unemployment insurance filings since the crisis began. Industries that took a direct hit, like restaurants and travel, bore the brunt of the job losses early on. But as the ripple effects permeate through the broader economy, companies of all stripes may be forced to pare down their headcounts.

Bloomberg reported late Thursday that IBM has cut an unspecified number of U.S. jobs across at least five states. The tech giant did not disclose the number of job cuts, but a source that lost his job said that the cuts were far-ranging and likely in the thousands.

""IBM's work in a highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly add high-value skills to our workforce. While we always consider the current environment, IBM's workforce decisions are in the interest of the long-term health of our business,"" said IBM spokesman Ed Barbini.

The pandemic has put pressure on IBM's results, particularly in the software business. In the first-quarter earnings call, CFO James Kavanaugh noted a pause in client activity, with deals that would have typically been closed in the last two weeks of the quarter pushed back. IBM also pulled its full-year guidance due to uncertainty.

IBM has been cutting jobs in some areas for years as it's shifted toward high-growth and high-value areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. It's unclear how many of the most recent job cuts were part of that process, and how many were the direct result of the pandemic's impact on the business.

Shares of IBM were down about 0.7% Friday morning. Before the pandemic, 2020 was shaping up to be a solid year for the century-old tech giant, driven by a recently launched mainframe system and the acquisition of Red Hat. But with the U.S. likely already in a deep recession, a return to growth will have to wait.

Apple aims for podcast exclusives

With the iPhone no longer much of a growth business for Apple, the company is relying on services to drive sales higher in the coming years. Services generated $26 billion of revenue for Apple in the six months ended March 28, bigger than all other product categories except for the iPhone.

Part of Apple's services push is content. The company launched its Apple TV+ streaming service late last year, giving away a free year of the $4.99 monthly service to anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac. While that offer brought millions of users onto the service, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted earlier this year that no more than 10% of those eligible for the free trial had bothered to activate it.

Compared to services like Netflix or Disney's Disney+, Apple TV+ is light on content. Disney+ has been the streaming success story of the past year, with its vast catalog of TV shows and movies driving the subscriber count beyond 50 million. Apple TV+ has tens of millions of subscribers as well, but only because of the free trial.

On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has plans to use exclusive podcasts to promote its Apple TV+ service. The company is reportedly looking for an executive to lead the initiative, and it's started buying original podcasts that are spinoffs of current Apple TV+ content, as well as podcasts that could be adapted into future Apple TV+ content.

Podcasts may never produce much of a profit for Apple, but the company can use podcasts to drive adoption of Apple TV+, which could eventually become a big moneymaker. However, Apple remains at a disadvantage to other streaming services that already have vast troves of content. Competing effectively will likely require many billions in content spending annually.

Shares of Apple were roughly flat Friday morning. The stock is less than 4% below its 52-week high."

With good reason, Jim Cramer says.

In a precarious market, investors will reach for the stock equivalent of comfort food, Jim Cramer told his Mad Money viewers Wednesday. Today, that comfort food came in the way of the tried and true FAANG stocks of Facebook (FB) - Get Report, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report, Apple (AAPL) - Get Report, Netflix (NFLX) - Get Report and Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report.

This market has seen some winners over the past few weeks, from consumer packaged goods and healthcare to big box retail and the semiconductors. One of those winners has been Lowe's (LOW) - Get Report, which reported strong earnings and an 11.2% increase in same store sales. Cramer checked in with Lowe's CEO, Marvin Ellison, to learn more.

Ellison said Lowe's remains committed to the health and safety of their employees and supporting the local communities they serve. He said that despite the pandemic, housing remains healthy and we still see a shortage of new homes and many aging homes in need of remodeling.

That's why customers have been flocking to Lowe's, as the company offers many ways to buy, including curbside pickup and delivery options. Lowe's continues to invest in its online operations, partnering with Google Cloud to build a world-class online operation, he said.

When asked for his outlook, Ellison said that brighter days are ahead and this virus will be beaten. He said small independent contractors are doing better and we will recover from this disruption.

Executive Decision: Facebook

For his second ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, to learn more about their new small business initiatives.

Sandberg said COVID-19 isn't just a health crisis, it's also an economic one. When surveyed, 31% of small businesses said they had stopped operating with 11% expecting to close their doors forever. Many feared not being able to rehire the employees they were forced to let go.

Given these tremendous pressures, Facebook announced their Shops program, which allows any business to set up a presence on Facebook and communicate with their customers for free. Sandberg said Facebook has listings for 160 million small businesses around the globe and eight million of them are advertising on the Facebook platform. Now anyone with a business can migrate online quickly and for free.

Sandberg said Facebook doesn't want to do everything themselves. They've partnered with online store providers like Shopify (SHOP) - Get Report to make it easy to connect your existing store and list your items. You can do it in minutes from your living room, she said.

Executive Decision: Mondelez

For his third ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer checked in with Dirk Van De Put, CEO of Mondelez (MDLZ) - Get Report, for the latest read on the packaged foods sector.

Van De Put said in times of lockdowns and quarantines, consumers want comfort and they're turning to trusted brands like Oreo, Ritz and Cadbury. Snacking has been trending higher since the pandemic began and Van De Put said that trend is likely here to stay as a percentage of consumers will stay at home.

While snacking differs from generation to generation, Van De Put said that brands like Oreo are just as popular with Generation Z and millennials as it is with older consumers.

When asked about the state of the world economy, Van De Put explained that China is starting to come back, but India and Southeast Asia remain in strict lockdowns. Things are trending toward recovery in both the U.S. and Europe, but Latin America is still seeing cases rise and will likely be the slowest region to recover.

Executive Decision: Verizon

For his next ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer checked in Hans Vestberg, chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications (VZ) - Get Report, the telecom provider with a 4.5% yield.

Vestberg said communications are essential in times like these, which is why Verizon chose to accelerate their investments into 5G technology to keep our economy moving. He said there are a small percentage of customers taking advantage of their Keep America Connected program, but so far they have not seen sizable disruptions.

When asked about 5G, Vestberg said Verizon is building the fastest 5G network, not just for consumers, but also for industry and government to create all new services. Verizon's 5G is up to 20 times faster than their 4G LTE and will support transactions, video communications and augmented reality services, Vestberg said.

Beware False Idols

In his ""No Huddle Offense"" segment, Cramer reminded viewers that even the smartest money managers get it wrong sometimes, which is why you should take everything they say with a grain of salt. No one has a crystal ball, Cramer said, and money managers change their minds all the time without alerting the public.

Back on March 18 and 19 a pair of money managers, Bill Ackman and Ray Dalio, appeared on CNBC with emotional comments, predicting doom and gloom and a second Great Depression if our government didn't act quickly. Those comments came right as the markets bottomed.

It turns out our government did act quickly and had you sold everything, you would have missed the entire rally. Think for yourself, Cramer concluded, even the money managers don't have all of the answers.

Lightning Round

Here's what Jim Cramer had to say about some of the stocks that callers offered up during the Mad Money Lightning Round Wednesday evening:

Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) - Get Report: ""The retail world came to an end and it will be difficult for them to come back.""

TE Connectivity (TEL) - Get Report: ""This is the kind of company that works. I'd buy it.""

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, tech has been one relatively bright spot for investors lately. Yet like a virus that keeps circulating, ever-escalating U.S.-China tensions threaten the health of the sector’s rally, with Apple once again thrust in the middle of the two countries’ battle.

As we reported last week, the U.S. government, via the Commerce Department, curtailed Huawei Technologies’ access to semiconductors that use U.S. technology, which in turn led to hints that China would be quick to retaliate in kind to U.S. companies. This isn’t the first time that Apple (ticker: AAPL) has been found itself in the spotlight amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, but of course it’s even less welcome now than it was during the trade war rounds in 2018 and 2019, when Covid-19 wasn’t an overarching existential threat. Now, those hoping that the tug of war pulling at Apple was firmly in the rearview mirror have to add that back to their list of worries.

Wedbush’s Daniel Ives calls Friday’s move by the U.S. “a major shot across the bow to China,” made all the more worrisome by the fact that some media reports have China set to put major U.S. tech companies including Apple, Qualcomm (QCOM), and Cisco Systems (CSCO) on an “unreliable entity list.” (This sort of tit-for-tat action is a familiar one, which crept up fairly regularly during the protracted trade-war negotiations, so it wouldn’t be surprising.)

Editor's Choice

Ives notes that Apple is “seeing pressure on both ends of the spectrum.” On the supply side, the company has “’bet the farm’ on its Foxconn factory and it represents the hearts and lungs of the Cupertino iPhone franchise.” And on the demand side, he notes that China is still a “growth linchpin region for the company representing roughly 20% of all iPhone upgrades over the next 12 to 18 months with our estimation that 60 million to 70 million iPhones in China are currently in the window of opportunity.”

If push came to shove, Ives thinks that Apple could only move about 5% to 7% of its iPhone production to alternative countries, such as India and Vietnam, in the next two years.

Yet it might not actually come to that: “While uncertainty will add to an already worrisome near-term situation around the global demand picture for Apple, the fundamental impact on iPhone production and the potential backlash in the region thus far is more bark than bite at this point in our opinion.” After all, stores are reopening in many Asian markets (as well as in the U.S.), with a supply chain that’s getting back on its feet and toward normalization, “Apple is starting to lay the early groundwork for the next chapter of growth,” especially with the much anticipated iPhone 12 still slated to launch later this year.

That leads him to maintain an Outperform rating and $350 price target on Apple, despite the latest negative developments.

As of Sunday, it had reopened 99 Apple Stores globally.

X

This week, the iPhone maker expects to reopen 25 more stores in the U.S., 12 in Canada, and 10 in Italy, 9to5Mac reported Sunday.

In a letter to customers Sunday, Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people, said returning customers can expect significant changes at the reopened Apple Stores.

""In every store, we're focused on limiting occupancy and giving everybody lots of room,"" she said. ""Face coverings will be required for all of our teams and customers, and we will provide them to customers who don't bring their own.""

Temperature Checks, Deep Cleanings At Apple Stores

Apple Stores also plans to conduct temperature checks of customers at the door. Posted health questions will screen those with symptoms, such as cough or fever. It will also ask if anyone has had recent exposure to someone infected with Covid‑19.

""Throughout the day, we're conducting enhanced deep cleanings that place special emphasis on all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas,"" O'Brien said. Plus, many stores will offer curbside pickup.

The reopening of Apple Stores is a positive step for the company as it attempts to return to normal operations, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a note to clients Monday. He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 350.

""With stores opening up to strong demand throughout Asia and a handful of U.S. stores opening their doors, coupled by a recovering supply chain, which is on the path to normalization, it appears Apple is starting to lay the early groundwork for the next chapter of growth recovery,"" Ives said. Key for Apple will be the launch of the iPhone 12 later this year, he said.

'Twists And Turns' Forecast For The Road Ahead

Apple's O'Brien said the situation with Covid-19 is fluid.

""A store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,"" O'Brien said. ""The response to Covid‑19 is still ongoing, and we recognize that the road back will have its twists and turns.""

Apple was among the first companies to close its stores, starting in late January in mainland China with the early Covid-19 outbreaks. It began reopening its Apple Stores in China several weeks later.

On March 13, it closed all Apple Stores outside of Greater China to slow the spread of the disease. Apple began reopening some of its retail stores outside of Greater China in April, starting in South Korea.

On the stock market today, Apple stock rose 2.4% to 314.96.

30,Dow Jones News: Microsoft Partners With FedEx; Apple Stock Rises as Stores Slowly Reopen,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCGDUcteV20AEyjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411779/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f18%2fdow-jones-news-microsoft-partners-with-fedex-apple.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=_fYB5iMMuKKaZ2kL8nCXgq6iC04-,2020-05-18 00:00:00,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) had surged 3.4% by 12:50 p.m. EDT Monday. The rally was likely driven by two pieces of news. First, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in an interview on 60 Minutes that the Fed was ""not out of ammunition by a long shot"" as it combats the negative impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Second, an early-stage vaccine trial showed positive results.

Tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) underperformed the market on Monday, although both stocks still managed to rise. Microsoft announced a collaboration with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to offer logistics solutions, and Apple plans to open more of its U.S. stores this week.

Microsoft cloud powers FedEx collaboration

FedEx is not a huge fan of e-commerce giant Amazon.com. A Bloomberg article earlier this year described the company as ""a kind of anti-Amazon ally for big-box retailers."" FedEx founder Fred Smith expects the company's strategy, which involves strengthening relationships with brick-and-mortar retailers, to allow it to overtake rival UPS within the next few years.

FedEx will get some help from a logical source, given its anti-Amazon slant. On Monday, FedEx and Microsoft announced a multi-year collaboration that will combine FedEx's logistics capabilities with Microsoft's cloud technology. Joint offerings will be developed for customers using Microsoft Azure and Dynamics 365, with the goal being to ""reinvent the most critical aspects of the commerce experience and enable businesses to better compete in today's increasingly digital landscape.""

The first solution to emerge from this partnership is FedEx Surround, which aims to use data and near-real-time analytics to improve supply chain visibility. The solution is particularly well suited for businesses that depend on time-sensitive deliveries. Two examples given in the announcement: ""...a hospital may urgently need a package to help save a life, or a part may need rapid transport to a manufacturing facility to avoid an operational shutdown.""

Microsoft has grown its Azure cloud infrastructure business rapidly in recent years, putting it behind only Amazon Web Services in terms of market share. Microsoft's biggest advantage may be that it's not Amazon. A company like FedEx, which is increasingly competing with Amazon as the e-commerce giant builds out its own logistics capabilities, certainly isn't going to turn to Amazon for cloud computing capabilities if it has an alternative option.

Shares of Microsoft were up just 1.1% by early Monday afternoon, trailing the broader market substantially. However, the stock has performed well in recent weeks, and it's close to surpassing its 52-week high.

Apple slowly opens stores

With the economy being reopened in many U.S. states, Apple is slowly reopening its retail stores to the public. The tech giant plans to open more than 25 of its stores in the U.S. this week, adding to stores it has already reopened around the world. Around 20% of its global retail stores have been reopened at this point, including five in the U.S. that were opened last week.

While Apple doesn't disclose how much revenue it derives from its stores alone, it does disclose how much revenue it generates from selling products directly to its customers. Direct sales channels include Apple's retail stores, e-commerce, and its direct sales force. In fiscal 2019, 31% of Apple's revenue came from direct sales channels.

The closing of many retail stores across the U.S. due to the pandemic has greatly impacted demand for Apple's products. Last week, data from KeyBanc Capital Markets indicated that U.S. iPhone sales tumbled 77% in April compared to the prior-year period. Sales were down 56% from March.

As retail stores reopen, Apple should see a rebound in demand. However, with the U.S. economy deeply depressed and unlikely to fully recover anytime soon, demand for Apple's pricey gadgets may remain soft for quite some time. Shares of Apple were up 2.3% by early Monday afternoon."
31,Why Spotify's Joe Rogan Exclusivity Is Such a Big Deal,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCGDUcteV20AFSjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByM3V1YTVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411779/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f21%2fwhy-spotifys-joe-rogan-exclusivity-is-such-a-big-d.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=ne_PO_vnEKC7RAqgMi_JQnKvAS0-,2020-05-21 00:00:00,"Regardless of how you feel about Joe Rogan, one simple fact is indisputable: The comedian-turned-podcaster has a massive audience. That's partly why shares of Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) have soared to fresh 52-week highs -- levels not seen since 2018 -- after the Swedish music-streaming leader announced this week that it had scored an exclusivity deal with Rogan for The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) podcast as part of its ongoing push into podcasts.

Here's why the partnership is such a big deal.

Rogan's following is enormous

Spotify has spent the past year fleshing out its podcasting strategy, challenging Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) long-standing dominance in podcast distribution. Part of that initiative entails securing original content for the platform, and in no uncertain terms JRE will become the biggest exclusive podcast for Spotify's audio-streaming platform.

JRE, which has never been available on Spotify thus far, will debut on the service on Sept. 1 before becoming completely exclusive in late 2020. The streaming tech company notes that Rogan will retain full creative control over the podcast even though Spotify will become the exclusive distribution partner. The show will be available to all of Spotify's 286 million monthly active users (MAUs), including both free users and paid subscribers.

Not only is that a blow to Apple, but also Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google, as Rogan's channel on YouTube has nearly 9 million subscribers, with each episode typically garnering around 2 million to 3 million views each. Certain episodes that feature high-profile guests like Elon Musk can enjoy a much larger audience (Musk's appearance on JRE last week has 13 million views). Clips will still be available on YouTube, but people will have to go to Spotify for full episodes.

The media personality has previously disclosed that JRE is downloaded 190 million times per month. ""That number's crazy,"" Rogan told fellow podcaster Aubrey Marcus a little over a year ago. Rogan also has 6.1 million followers on Twitter, and 9.5 million followers on Facebook's Instagram.

Financial terms around the partnership were not formally disclosed, but the deal is reportedly worth over $100 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Spotify's market cap increased by $5.3 billion in the two days since the announcement.

Spotify's ""Howard Stern"" moment

In some ways, the JRE deal loosely resembles SiriusXM's original exclusivity deal with Howard Stern in 2006, another provocative media personality with an enormous -- and loyal -- fan base. That arrangement was widely considered a blowout success for both Sirius and Stern. One notable difference between the Stern and Rogan exclusivity deals is that SiriusXM requires a subscription, allowing the company to better recoup its costs, while Spotify offers an ad-supported tier.

That being said, Spotify has grand plans to modernize podcast advertising with dynamic ad insertion technology that can leverage Spotify's user data for more advanced ad targeting than is currently available in the podcasting space. Ads will never bring as much money as paid subscriptions, but Spotify has said the growing podcast catalog has bolstered conversion rates of free users to paid subscribers.

Time will tell if this move pays off, but chances are it will in spades."
32,3 Soaring Tech Stocks to Buy Now for Coronavirus Growth and Beyond,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCGDUcteV20AFyjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByc3RzMXFjBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM0BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411779/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2ffinance.yahoo.com%2fnews%2f3-soaring-tech-stocks-buy-185406801.html/RK=2/RS=mLvg7NPzJRNvEvar4EQFG9o6QTA-,2020-05-19 18:54:06+00:00,"All three major U.S. indexes surged to start the week on the back of positive coronavirus vaccine news, which came as economies around the world slowly begin to reopen from their coronavirus-induced lockdowns. Plus, Fed Chairman Jay Powell’s 60 Minutes interview on Sunday highlighted why investors are likely set to remain in ‘don’t fight the Fed’ mode.

Wall Street has been looking ahead to the coronavirus recovery for the better part of two months. And investors haven’t seemed deterred by some rough quarterly earnings results, which are expected to get far worse in Q2—when we will hopefully see the full impact of the coronavirus shutdown.

Despite the uncertainty, tech stocks from giants like Facebook FB and Apple AAPL to Zoom ZM have proved resilient. And some stocks within the broader tech industry have hit new highs on the back of impressive growth during the coronavirus pandemic. Let’s dive into three of these growth-focused tech stocks that investors might want to buy right now…

Inphi Corporation IPHI

Inphi makes semiconductor components and optical subsystems and is a leader in data movement interconnects between and inside data centers. Inphi’s Q1 results wowed Wall Street on May 7, with revenue up 70%. Higher demand for cloud and telecom products helped drive sales, as did the inclusion of eSilicon, which it officially purchased in January.

Inphi’s record top-line growth came on top of the year-ago period’s 37% expansion. The firm was already benefiting from a data center boom, the transition to 5G, and more. And CEO Ford Tamer expects the “significant paradigm shifts” caused by the coronavirus, from remote work to e-commerce, might encourage “further acceleration of bandwidth upgrades.” IPHI shares surged after its release, with the stock now up over 50% in 2020 and 235% in the past two years.

IPHI is currently trading right near new highs, which is no easy task amid the uncertainty. And its strong earnings revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. Our Zacks estimates call for Inphi’s adjusted FY20 earnings to surge 66%, on 66% higher revenue.

The compnay, which helps “move big data fast, around the globe"" is projected to follow up this growth with double-digit sales and earnings growth in FY21. Inphi is also part of a highly-ranked Zacks industry and sports an “A” grade for Growth and a “B” for Momentum in our Style Scores system.

Chegg CHGG

Chegg began as an online textbook hub geared toward college students. This remains a solid niche within an Amazon AMZN-dominated e-commerce market. Today, Chegg refers to itself as a “direct-to student learning platform,” having expanded its portfolio to include online tutors, test prep, and more.

Digital learning was already growing in popularity prior to the pandemic. ""Our belief is that, in every industry, a crisis often accelerates the inevitable and that is what we see happening in higher education,” CEO Dan Rosensweig said in prepared Q1 remarks.

Chegg’s Q1 sales jumped 35%, with its services revenue up 33%. CHGG projects that its Q2 subscriber growth will “be greater than 45%.” Looking ahead, CHGG’s full-year sales are expected to jump roughly 35% to hit $552.65 million, which would top FY19’s 28% expansion. Meanwhile, Chegg’s adjusted fiscal year EPS figures are projected to jump 33% and 22%, respectively in the next two years.

Shares of Chegg have soared over 120% in the last two months and over 50% since its Q1 release on May 4. This growth is also part of a longer positive trend that has seen CHGG stock skyrocket over 675% in the last five years. And Chegg’s bottom-line revision strength helps it hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), within an industry that sits in the top 11% of our more than 250 Zacks industries.

Some investors might want to wait for a pullback, but Wall Street could continue to scoop up stocks that can expand during these times. And longer-term investors might want to view Chegg as a bet on the future of education becoming more digitally focused, especially as costs and student debt grow out of control.

ServiceNow NOW

ServiceNow provides cloud-based services and solutions to its over 6,200 enterprise customers. The digital workflow firm was added to the S&P 500 index in November 2019 and has expanded its partnership with Microsoft MSFT to help it sell to highly regulated industries and house its full SaaS offerings on MSFT’s popular Azure cloud. Now topped our Q1 earnings and sales estimates at the end of April, with subscription revenue up 34%."

By Paresh Dave

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to contact tracing technology from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc’s Google, the companies announced on Wednesday as they released the initial version of their system.

But authorities would have to stop requiring phone numbers from users under the companies' rules, one of several restrictions that have left governments fighting the novel coronavirus frustrated that the world's top two smartphone software makers undercut the technology's usefulness by prioritizing user privacy.

Apple and Google said several U.S. states and 22 countries have sought access to their technology, but it is unclear how many will end up publishing mobile apps that use it.

Using apps to accelerate contact tracing, in which authorities identify and test people who were recently near a virus carrier, has emerged as a tool to stem new outbreaks. It could help authorities test more potentially infected individuals than they would normally be able to based on patients recalling recent interactions from memory.

But some governments contend their app-based efforts would be more effective if they could track users' locations to identify hot spots for virus transmission and notify them about possible exposure through calls or texts, rather than a generic push notification.

Apple and Google have barred authorities using their technology from collecting GPS location data or requiring users to enter personal data.

""We have a collision of tech, privacy and health professionals and the Venn diagram doesn’t really have a spot where they all overlap,"" said Chester Wisniewski, a principal research scientist at cybersecurity company Sophos.

Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries that have sought to develop their own technology are experiencing glitches, draining device batteries and seeing limited adoption.

Apple and Google have said their system will more reliably use Bluetooth connections between devices to log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes.

Developers of contact tracing apps for Austria, Germany and Switzerland told Reuters this week they were moving forward with the Apple-Google technology and were fine not knowing users' phone numbers.

Other governments are hedging their bets. Norway plans to compare the effectiveness of its Smittestopp app with an Apple-Google-based app, Gun Peggy Knudsen, acting deputy director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in an interview.

Smittestopp, which has a development budget of about $5 million, accesses GPS location and requires phone numbers. But it has seen limited use because of a low number of new infections.

""If the tracing is so much better with the Apple-Google tool, then perhaps we should switch and we would consider what we need to do to do the switch,"" Knudsen said.

North Dakota, which offered the first U.S. contact tracing app, told Reuters on Wednesday it will leave its initial Care19 app as a location-tracking ""diary"" tool to help patients jog their memories. But it also will release a new Care19 Exposure app based on the Apple-Google technology.

The Australian government said it was in talks with Apple and Google about enhancing its COVIDSafe app, which currently requires phone numbers, postcodes and age ranges."

AAPL released the initial version of their COVID-19 contact-tracing app. The companies said that authorities of 23 countries across five continents have sought access to their contact-tracing technology.

The technology has been designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus by tracking who a person has been in close contact with. Tech players, particularly the FAANG companies, have been playing a major role in fighting the coronavirus. While most industries have taken a beating due to the pandemic, tech players have been one of the few to have not only survived the pandemic but also put up a great show.

Google, Apple Show the Way

Apple and Google on May 20 made available the first public version of their exposure notification API, which originally debuted as a joint contact-tracing software tool. The technology uses a Bluetooth-based system to store data on people’s phones and not a central database. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the system can send notification to anyone who was recently near that person and alerts them to contact the local authority to get medical advice and a coronavirus test.

Apple and Google will not be making the actual contact-tracing app but only share their technology. The apps will be developed by the respective governments and health bodies that have requested for the technology. Notably, the technology has been included in iPhone and Android updates released to the public on May 20. Shares of Apple and Google have gained 15.3% and 11.7%, respectively, over the past 30 days. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Google carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

FAANG Companies Fight COVID-19

Lately, federal regulators have been scrutinizing how the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Inc. FB Google, Twitter, Inc. TWTR and others handle personal information amid rapidly increasing incidences of user data breach. Twitter has a Zacks Rank #3. Its shares have surged 19.3% over the past one month.

The COVID-19 outbreak has given tech companies an opportunity to rebuild their image. At the same time, an increasing number of people are relying on online purchases, with stay-at-home orders in place. This has seen a rise in e-commerce sales, growth in demand for video and online games, and a surge in users of streaming services.

On May 19, Facebook rolled out Facebook Shops, a feature allows businesses to set up product listings on their Facebook Page, Instagram profile, Stories or in ads. Users can browse and buy products directly from a business’ Facebook page or Instagram profile. Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3. Its shares have gained 29% in the past 30 days.

Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Inc. NFLX has been one of the biggest winners during the pandemic. Last month, the streaming giant said that it added 15.8 million subscribers in the first quarter, taking its global total to 182.9 million. The company had predicted that it would add around 7 million customers during the period. Netflix said that it users grew only in mid-March when stay-at-home restrictions were well in place. Shares of Netflix, which has a Zacks Rank #2, have increased 2.3% in the last one month.

Similarly, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Inc. AMZN too has been making the most of the opportunity. So much so, that the e-commerce giant had to go on a hiring spree. Last month, Amazon said that it will be hiring 75,000 more heads, ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers to ramp up delivery services and meet the growing demand for online orders. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have gained 4.4% in the past one month.

The coronavirus outbreak has also given tech companies a chance to rebuild their image by fighting fake news. Last month, Facebook launched a service in Italy in collaboration with Facta that will allow users to verify the authenticity of any information related to the novel coronavirus.

Also, Google in April announced that it would pump in $6.5 million into fact-checkers and nonprofits to ramp up its fight against coronavirus-related misinformation. Twitter too has been fighting fake news related to COVID-19. The micro-blogging site has removed more than 1,100 misleading and potentially damaging tweets since March after it announced a new guidance that bars content which could prove to be harmful.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is shown atop an Apple store at a shopping mall in La Jolla, California

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Apple (NASDAQ: )'s main regulator in the European Union, on Thursday said it was in contact with the company after a whistleblower called for action over a programme that listens to users' recordings.

The regulator acted after Thomas Le Bonniec, a former Apple contractor, wrote to European data protection regulators on May 20 to push for investigations into these practices.

""The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes,"" Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

""However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses,"" he said, in reference to the letter. ""In addition, it should be noted that the European Data Protection Board is working on the production of guidance in the area of voice assistant technologies.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors.

36,Investing in These 3 Top Stocks Could Double Your Money,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCGDUcteV20AHyjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411779/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f22%2finvesting-in-these-3-top-stocks-could-double-your.aspx/RK=2/RS=DzLPKVNMSOpqWYc_IIzbj7gA7_I-,2020-05-22 00:00:00,"Maybe you've had some cash on the sidelines as major market indices have rebounded sharply from lows in March and feel like you've missed all the good investment opportunities. Or perhaps you've invested some money during the recent downturn but still have more you'd like to put to work in hopes that it can help grow your portfolio over the long haul. The big question, of course, is where to invest?

Consider buying shares of tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), insurance and investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A), and data-driven ad-buying specialist The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). Despite the market's move higher recently, there are still some good opportunities for patient investors -- and these three companies' stocks are great examples. Indeed, these three stocks collectively have the potential to double your money over the next five to seven years. This translates to an average return of about 10% to 15% annually.

Here's a closer look at each of these stock picks -- and why they have a good chance of outperforming the overall market in the years ahead.

Berkshire Hathaway

One of the rare high-quality stocks still trading near the low it saw in March is Berkshire Hathaway -- the insurance and investment conglomerate led by famed investor Warren Buffett. Shares are the cheapest they've been in years, trading below 1.2 times book value.

Warren Buffett himself seems to think shares of Berkshire Hathaway are a good deal. Berkshire has spent more money buying Berkshire Hathaway stock over the past two quarters than it has spent buying any other stocks. It seems Berkshire is one of the Oracle of Omaha's best ideas.

Apple

Another investment to consider is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding (by far), Apple. Berkshire's stake in the tech giant is currently valued at more than $80 billion. To put this wager into perspective, the amount of Berkshire's next three largest investments combined totals about $54 billion. Or here's another way to put it: Apple stock represents about 40% of Berkshire's total equity portfolio.

While shares of the tech company have surged recently, they remain compelling today. Apple boasts an installed base of active devices greater than 1.5 billion -- a figure that's consistently grown every quarter. Further, the tech giant is monetizing these users with services, evidenced by its fast-growing services business (which now accounts for about a third of total gross profit). In addition, Apple continues to demonstrate prowess in launching new products and becoming a market leader in those new categories. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods, for instance, are the leading products in their respective fast-growing categories.

Sure, at 25 times earnings, Apple stock isn't cheap. But sometimes, it's worth paying up for quality. The tech giant looks poised to grow both its hardware and services revenue in the coming years, and its higher-margin services revenue will likely grow as a percentage of total revenue.

The Trade Desk

To finish off this trio, investors should consider buying shares of The Trade Desk. This is the fastest-growing company of the bunch -- but investors will have to pay a steep price tag to get in on this growth story. The company trades at 116 times earnings.

In 2019, the advertising-technology company's revenue jumped by 35% year over year. Even more, its non-GAAP (adjusted) net income skyrocketed from $51.1 million in 2018 to $71.6 million in 2019 -- and that figure was on just $215.9 million in 2019 revenue.

The Trade Desk is early in its growth story. As the leading independent data-driven advertising platform, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing shift of ad spend from traditional TV to internet-connected TV, where programmatic advertising (The Trade Desk's specialty) has potential to dominate.

Analysts expect huge earnings growth in the years ahead. On average, analysts forecast The Trade Desk's earnings per share to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 31% over the next five years.

A bet that could double your money

While all three of these companies will have to work through near-term challenges associated with COVID-19's impact on the economy, they all look like promising bets for the long term. More importantly, all three companies have a track record of strong execution. Indeed, it wouldn't be surprising if the value of an investment in these three companies today could double over the next five to seven years."
37,Amazon Leapfrogs Apple in Fortune 500,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCGDUcteV20AISjQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByN3UwbTk1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM5BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411779/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f20%2famazon-leapfrogs-apple-in-fortune-500.aspx/RK=2/RS=83ZsGXf35_V3.tOUilU_yVhP0E0-,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"Fortune released its annual Fortune 500 rankings this week, listing the largest companies by revenue generated last year. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was able to pull off a major coup: The e-commerce behemoth has leapfrogged Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the No. 2 company behind Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which ranked No. 1 for the eighth consecutive year.

Here's how the distinguished list changed for 2020.

Amazon won't overtake Walmart anytime soon

As the biggest retailer on Earth, Walmart's revenue of $524 billion remains comfortably ahead of any other company. Amazon's top line grew by 21% in 2019 to reach $281 billion, climbing the highest it's ever been in the rankings. Keep in mind that the list is based on 2019 revenue -- i.e., before the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide. The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the shift to e-commerce as people shop from the safety of their homes, and Amazon has seen a spike in demand as a result.

Meanwhile, Apple's revenue has seemingly plateaued as iPhone sales slow and the company looks to other segments like services and wearables to pick up the slack. But considering the sheer size of the iPhone business, it takes a lot to compensate for iPhone declines. The Cupertino tech giant's revenue fell a modest 2% last year to $260 billion, with its ranking slipping to No. 4.

Here's how the top five companies have changed over the past several years.

Rank 2018 2019 2020 1 Walmart Walmart Walmart 2 ExxonMobil ExxonMobil Amazon 3 Berkshire Hathaway Apple ExxonMobil 4 Apple Berkshire Hathaway Apple 5 UnitedHealth Amazon CVS Health

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was all the way down at No. 21 with $126 billion, even as the enterprise software juggernaut boasts the highest market cap ($1.4 trillion) because investors are pricing in higher growth expectations from its booming cloud business. The most valuable companies in the Fortune 500 now fetch a combined market valuation of $4.6 trillion. In terms of market cap, Apple's is just under $1.4 trillion and Amazon is worth a little over $1.2 trillion.

With the annual reshuffling, Apple CEO Tim Cook's preferred (and frustrating) way of disclosing the size of the wearables business is rendered irrelevant. Cook likes to compare the wearables business to the list, even though all the thresholds and rankings change every year. For example, the most recent such comparison was that Apple's wearables business was the size of a Fortune 150 company, translating into $20.8 billion in revenue based on last year's rankings. No. 150 this year is Rite Aid, with $21.7 billion."

Huberty, a highly-influential Wall Street analyst with a track record for accurately forecasting Apple earnings, told her colleague, Tesla analyst Adam Jonas, that the two companies will be viewed as competitors in the years ahead, with vertically integrated solutions that would make a partnership unlikely.

When asked about her thoughts on Tesla, Huberty said that ""there are parallels to draw between AAPL under Steve Jobs and Tesla under Elon Musk.""

Jonas then asked about the lessons Huberty could share about founders/owners and operators of companies that could apply specifically for Tesla.

""Nobody else will devote every ounce of themselves to a company like a founder. With a founder, the company becomes its life and their life becomes their company. There are both positives and negatives to that dynamic. Importantly, there can be some very good years of innovation and hyper-growth... but then there’s a list of things that can become a distraction and it's just as important to surround a founder with strong business leaders and provide visibility into a longer-term succession plan,"" said Huberty.

39,China Ready to Drop the Hammer on American Tech Titans Such as Apple and Boeing in Retaliation for Huawei Sanctions,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgSKJUcteIiwA.SXQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411785/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwccftech.com%2fchina-ready-to-drop-the-hammer-on-american-tech-titans-such-as-apple-and-boeing-in-retaliation-for-huawei-sanctions%2f/RK=2/RS=.8mAggviWa9sLpRd6Iu5Su7nsQc-,2020-05-18 13:26:30+00:00,"China is widely expected to retaliate against the latest U.S. sanctions that have essentially crippled its preeminent tech company, Huawei Technologies. According to the Global Times, a publication closely tied with the Communist Party of China, the blowback will target American titans such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Boeing (NYSE:BA).

As a refresher, on the 15th of May, the Trump administration angered China by blocking silicon heavyweights around the globe from delivering semiconductor components to Huawei or its affiliate HiSilicon. Under the new regime, foreign semiconductor manufacturers that employ American technology or software will now be required to procure a formal license from the Trump administration before delivering these sensitive components to the Chinese tech giants. However, the Commerce Department did provide a concession by stating that the rule change does not affect the chipsets or wafers already in production at the time the directive was issued and that these components can be delivered to Huawei within 120 days. Through this decision, the U.S. officials effectively broadened the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign goods employing American technology or software to U.S. regulations. Given that a significant proportion of the global chipmaking industry utilizes technology and intellectual property sourced from the United States, this step would, in effect, substantially enhance American export control authority.

Huawei’s 5G Gear Set To Lose British Market As Johnson Gets Ball Rolling

The final nail in the coffin, however, came today when the Taiwan-based TSMC (NYSE:TSM) halted all new orders from China's Huawei Technologies in compliance with Friday’s directive of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Bear in mind that Huawei is the TSMC’s second-biggest customer after Apple, accounting for around 15 to 20 percent of the Taiwanese chipmaker’s annual revenue. The move has essentially crippled Huawei’s future flagship smartphone lineup as well as 5G ambitions given that HiSilicon remains incapable of producing high-quality chips that these product offerings require. Bear in mind that Huawei's Kirin 980, 985, and 990 chipsets are built on TSMC's 7nm nodes while the Kirin 1080 SoC employs TSMC's 5nm node. Nonetheless, perhaps in anticipation of these restrictions, Huawei has assembled a substantial stockpile of these chipsets and, consequently, will not run out of its stock for a while.

This move by the Trump administration, though widely expected, has generated waves of intense anger in China. As an illustration, the Global Times published a piece on the 17th of May, noting that:

“Such unreasonable suppression from Washington backfired in China and more calls have emerged urging acceleration of 'de-Americanization' to be fully adopted for the worst-case scenario, according to industry insiders and analysts, who claimed that a US political virus is now destroying the global supply chain, making everyone including its own firms like Qualcomm and Apple major victims.”

Moreover, Huawei employees and senior management widely circulated the slogan “drop the fantasies and prepare for a real battle"" on social media over the weekend. Apart from jingoistic sloganeering, the Global Times reports that China is mulling its countermeasures that now include a so-called list of “unreliable entities” that will be subjected to enhanced restrictions as well as cybersecurity and anti-monopoly probes. The list is expected to include Apple, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Boeing. Bear in mind that China’s Ministry of Commerce first floated this retaliatory measure back in 2019 when the ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said in a press conference that the country was drawing up a list to target all foreign individuals and companies that aim to block China’s supply chains or impose discriminatory measures for non-commercial reasons. Additionally, the Chinese government will reportedly now encourage its citizens to shun the products delivered by the companies that fall in the unreliable entities list, dealing a potentially massive blow to Apple’s presence in the world’s second-largest economy.

Of course, this step marks just the latest escalation in a long litany of measures that the Trump administration has instituted in recent months that antagonized China by curtailing Huawei’s financial and technological viability. For instance, in June 2019, the U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei to an ‘Entities List’ over national security concerns and for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. The move obligates U.S. companies to seek prior approval from the U.S. administration before transacting with such blacklisted companies, particularly, when it comes to the sale of semiconductor chips and other sensitive components. More recently, the U.S. government has been pressuring its allies to remove Huawei-sourced 5G telecommunication equipment from their respective 5G service rollout programs."

FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is shown atop an Apple store at a shopping mall in La Jolla, California

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Apple (NASDAQ: )'s main regulator in the European Union, on Thursday said it was in contact with the company after a whistleblower called for action over a programme that listens to users' recordings.

The regulator acted after Thomas Le Bonniec, a former Apple contractor, wrote to European data protection regulators on May 20 to push for investigations into these practices.

""The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes,"" Graham (NYSE: ) Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

""However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses,"" he said, in reference to the letter. ""In addition, it should be noted that the European Data Protection Board is working on the production of guidance in the area of voice assistant technologies.""

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.

Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors.

Le Bonniec's letter, seen by Reuters, which was published on Thursday, said in reference to EU data protection laws: ""Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.""

Le Bonniec worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Irish offices, he said in the letter."
41,Apple To Reopen More Than 25 U.S. Stores This Week,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgSKJUcteIiwA_iXQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBya2cwZmh2BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM1BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411785/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2ffinance.yahoo.com%2fnews%2fapple-reopen-more-25-u-130159708.html/RK=2/RS=9RM7NMsPm4W19V4R0SHEEYjBp20-,2020-05-18 13:01:59+00:00,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) said it is this week planning to reopen more than 25 of its U.S. stores after a two-month hiatus.

As of today, almost 100 of its stores globally have been able to open again. The iPhone maker has 510 stores worldwide and 271 in the U.S.

Some of the stores, which have been shut since mid-March to help contain the coronavirus spread, will let customers into the shops, while others will offer only curbside pickup service. However, Apple is still encouraging customers to purchase online where possible.

Apple has in recent weeks started to reopen stores in South Korea, Australia, and Germany.

The tech giant laid out safety and health and safety requirements to jumpstart the gradual reopening of its retail stores. As part of the effort, Apple will require its teams and customers to wear face coverings.

In addition, temperature checks will be conducted at the door, and posted health questions will screen for those with symptoms - like cough or fever - or those who have had recent exposure to someone infected with Covid‑19. Furthermore, Apple is committed to conduct enhanced deep cleanings of all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas throughout the day.

Shares in Apple have recovered from this year’s low at the end of March, appreciating some 37% since. The stock rose 2.1% to $314.07 in pre-market trading.

Five-star analyst Daniel Ives at Wedbush maintained his Buy rating on the stock with a $350 price target, reflecting 14% upside potential over the coming year.

“With stores opening up to strong demand throughout Asia and a handful of US stores opening their doors, coupled by a recovering supply chain which is on the path to normalization, it appears Apple is starting to lay the early groundwork for the next chapter of growth recovery in Cupertino with all eyes on the highly anticipated iPhone 12 launch later this year,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “In terms of the delayed 5G super cycle thesis with iPhone 12, we estimate that about 350 million of Apple's 925 million iPhones worldwide are in this upgrade window which remains the linchpin to our longer-term bullish thesis for Cupertino over the next 12 to 18 months.”

TipRanks data shows that the bullish outlook is shared by a majority of the Wall Street analyst community. Out of 33 analysts, 26 assign Buys, 4 have Holds and 1 has a Sell. The $317.92 average price target though indicates a mere 3.3% upside potential in the shares in the coming 12 months. (See Apple stock analysis on TipRanks)

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Inc. GOOGL, Apple, Inc. AAPL, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Inc. FB, Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Inc. NFLX and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Inc. AMZN.

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:

Google, Apple Launch Contact-Tracing App: FAANG Stocks to Gain

On May 20, Alphabet, Inc.’s Google and Apple, Inc. released the initial version of their COVID-19 contact-tracing app. The companies said that authorities of 23 countries across five continents have sought access to their contact-tracing technology.

The technology has been designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus by tracking who a person has been in close contact with. Tech players, particularly the FAANG companies, have been playing a major role in fighting the coronavirus. While most industries have taken a beating due to the pandemic, tech players have been one of the few to have not only survived the pandemic but also put up a great show.

Google, Apple Show the Way

Apple and Google on May 20 made available the first public version of their exposure notification API, which originally debuted as a joint contact-tracing software tool. The technology uses a Bluetooth-based system to store data on people’s phones and not a central database. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the system can send notification to anyone who was recently near that person and alerts them to contact the local authority to get medical advice and a coronavirus test.

Apple and Google will not be making the actual contact-tracing app but only share their technology. The apps will be developed by the respective governments and health bodies that have requested for the technology. Notably, the technology has been included in iPhone and Android updates released to the public on May 20. Shares of Apple and Google have gained 15.3% and 11.7%, respectively, over the past 30 days. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Google carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

FAANG Companies Fight COVID-19

Lately, federal regulators have been scrutinizing how the likes of Facebook, Inc. Google and others handle personal information amid rapidly increasing incidences of user data breach.

The COVID-19 outbreak has given tech companies an opportunity to rebuild their image. At the same time, an increasing number of people are relying on online purchases, with stay-at-home orders in place. This has seen a rise in e-commerce sales, growth in demand for video and online games, and a surge in users of streaming services.

On May 19, Facebook rolled out Facebook Shops, a feature allows businesses to set up product listings on their Facebook Page, Instagram profile, Stories or in ads. Users can browse and buy products directly from a business’ Facebook page or Instagram profile. Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3. Its shares have gained 29% in the past 30 days.

Netflix, Inc. has been one of the biggest winners during the pandemic. Last month, the streaming giant said that it added 15.8 million subscribers in the first quarter, taking its global total to 182.9 million. The company had predicted that it would add around 7 million customers during the period. Netflix said that it users grew only in mid-March when stay-at-home restrictions were well in place. Shares of Netflix, which has a Zacks Rank #2, have increased 2.3% in the last one month.

Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. too has been making the most of the opportunity. So much so, that the e-commerce giant had to go on a hiring spree. Last month, Amazon said that it will be hiring 75,000 more heads, ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers to ramp up delivery services and meet the growing demand for online orders. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have gained 4.4% in the past one month.

The coronavirus outbreak has also given tech companies a chance to rebuild their image by fighting fake news. Last month, Facebook launched a service in Italy in collaboration with Facta that will allow users to verify the authenticity of any information related to the novel coronavirus.

Also, Google in April announced that it would pump in $6.5 million into fact-checkers and nonprofits to ramp up its fight against coronavirus-related misinformation. Twitter too has been fighting fake news related to COVID-19. The micro-blogging site has removed more than 1,100 misleading and potentially damaging tweets since March after it announced a new guidance that bars content which could prove to be harmful.

Or perhaps you've invested some money during the recent downturn but still have more you'd like to put to work in hopes that it can help grow your portfolio over the long haul. The big question, of course, is where to invest?

Consider buying shares of tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), insurance and investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A), and data-driven ad-buying specialist The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD). Despite the market's move higher recently, there are still some good opportunities for patient investors -- and these three companies' stocks are great examples. Indeed, these three stocks collectively have the potential to double your money over the next five to seven years. This translates to an average return of about 10% to 15% annually.

Here's a closer look at each of these stock picks -- and why they have a good chance of outperforming the overall market in the years ahead.

Berkshire Hathaway

One of the rare high-quality stocks still trading near the low it saw in March is Berkshire Hathaway -- the insurance and investment conglomerate led by famed investor Warren Buffett. Shares are the cheapest they've been in years, trading below 1.2 times book value.

Warren Buffett himself seems to think shares of Berkshire Hathaway are a good deal. Berkshire has spent more money buying Berkshire Hathaway stock over the past two quarters than it has spent buying any other stocks. It seems Berkshire is one of the Oracle of Omaha's best ideas.

Apple

Another investment to consider is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding (by far), Apple. Berkshire's stake in the tech giant is currently valued at more than $80 billion. To put this wager into perspective, the amount of Berkshire's next three largest investments combined totals about $54 billion. Or here's another way to put it: Apple stock represents about 40% of Berkshire's total equity portfolio.

While shares of the tech company have surged recently, they remain compelling today. Apple boasts an installed base of active devices greater than 1.5 billion -- a figure that's consistently grown every quarter. Further, the tech giant is monetizing these users with services, evidenced by its fast-growing services business (which now accounts for about a third of total gross profit). In addition, Apple continues to demonstrate prowess in launching new products and becoming a market leader in those new categories. Both the Apple Watch and AirPods, for instance, are the leading products in their respective fast-growing categories.

Sure, at 25 times earnings, Apple stock isn't cheap. But sometimes, it's worth paying up for quality. The tech giant looks poised to grow both its hardware and services revenue in the coming years, and its higher-margin services revenue will likely grow as a percentage of total revenue.

The Trade Desk

To finish off this trio, investors should consider buying shares of The Trade Desk. This is the fastest-growing company of the bunch -- but investors will have to pay a steep price tag to get in on this growth story. The company trades at 116 times earnings.

In 2019, the advertising-technology company's revenue jumped by 35% year over year. Even more, its non-GAAP (adjusted) net income skyrocketed from $51.1 million in 2018 to $71.6 million in 2019 -- and that figure was on just $215.9 million in 2019 revenue.

The Trade Desk is early in its growth story. As the leading independent data-driven advertising platform, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing shift of ad spend from traditional TV to internet-connected TV, where programmatic advertising (The Trade Desk's specialty) has potential to dominate.

Analysts expect huge earnings growth in the years ahead. On average, analysts forecast The Trade Desk's earnings per share to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 31% over the next five years.

A bet that could double your money

While all three of these companies will have to work through near-term challenges associated with COVID-19's impact on the economy, they all look like promising bets for the long term. More importantly, all three companies have a track record of strong execution. Indeed, it wouldn't be surprising if the value of an investment in these three companies today could double over the next five to seven years."

By Steve Scherer

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will ramp up COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as it gradually lifts restrictions and is working closely with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google on a mobile phone app to help, the prime minister said on Friday.

In his daily news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government was already helping Ontario, the most populous province, with contact tracing and was open to do the same for the other 12 provinces and territories.

Businesses and citizens ""need to know that we have a coordinated approach to gradually reopen that is rooted in science, evidence and the ability to rapidly detect and control any future outbreaks,"" Trudeau said.

The western province of Alberta said on Friday it would test anyone in long-term care facilities, where most of the deaths have been recorded, even if they have no symptoms.

Canada's total cases rose to 81,765 on Friday, and deaths were up less than 2% to 6,180, official data showed.

With contagion slowing, provinces have been gradually reopening in recent weeks.

On Friday, Quebec said museums, libraries and drive-in movie theaters can open from May 29. In Calgary, the biggest city in Alberta, barber shops and hairstylists can restart from May 25, and restaurants and bars will be able to offer table service at half capacity.

On May 1, Alberta rolled out a digital-tracing tool to monitor outbreaks.

The apps are meant to help trace and call people who have come into contact with an individual infected with COVID-19.

Trudeau had not promoted the use of a tracing app, but on Friday he said the government was working ""closely"" with Apple and Google and would ""strongly recommend"" one as soon as their tracing technology is ready.

Critics are concerned that it will undermine civil liberties and privacy."

While many U.S. states are in the process of reopening after imposing lockdowns to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the full scope of the economic impact is still unknown. The Dow was down about 0.45% at 11:40 a.m. EDT.

Many companies are turning to layoffs to adjust to depressed demand. International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) has joined that club, with reports indicating that the tech company has let potentially thousands of employees go. Meanwhile, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking steps to grow its services business amid a slump in iPhone demand. The company is reportedly looking to use exclusive podcasts to promote its Apple TV+ streaming service.

Layoffs hit IBM

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy, leading to more than 38 million unemployment insurance filings since the crisis began. Industries that took a direct hit, like restaurants and travel, bore the brunt of the job losses early on. But as the ripple effects permeate through the broader economy, companies of all stripes may be forced to pare down their headcounts.

Bloomberg reported late Thursday that IBM has cut an unspecified number of U.S. jobs across at least five states. The tech giant did not disclose the number of job cuts, but a source that lost his job said that the cuts were far-ranging and likely in the thousands.

""IBM's work in a highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly add high-value skills to our workforce. While we always consider the current environment, IBM's workforce decisions are in the interest of the long-term health of our business,"" said IBM spokesman Ed Barbini.

The pandemic has put pressure on IBM's results, particularly in the software business. In the first-quarter earnings call, CFO James Kavanaugh noted a pause in client activity, with deals that would have typically been closed in the last two weeks of the quarter pushed back. IBM also pulled its full-year guidance due to uncertainty.

IBM has been cutting jobs in some areas for years as it's shifted toward high-growth and high-value areas like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. It's unclear how many of the most recent job cuts were part of that process, and how many were the direct result of the pandemic's impact on the business.

Shares of IBM were down about 0.7% Friday morning. Before the pandemic, 2020 was shaping up to be a solid year for the century-old tech giant, driven by a recently launched mainframe system and the acquisition of Red Hat. But with the U.S. likely already in a deep recession, a return to growth will have to wait.

Apple aims for podcast exclusives

With the iPhone no longer much of a growth business for Apple, the company is relying on services to drive sales higher in the coming years. Services generated $26 billion of revenue for Apple in the six months ended March 28, bigger than all other product categories except for the iPhone.

Part of Apple's services push is content. The company launched its Apple TV+ streaming service late last year, giving away a free year of the $4.99 monthly service to anyone buying a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac. While that offer brought millions of users onto the service, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted earlier this year that no more than 10% of those eligible for the free trial had bothered to activate it.

Compared to services like Netflix or Disney's Disney+, Apple TV+ is light on content. Disney+ has been the streaming success story of the past year, with its vast catalog of TV shows and movies driving the subscriber count beyond 50 million. Apple TV+ has tens of millions of subscribers as well, but only because of the free trial.

On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Apple has plans to use exclusive podcasts to promote its Apple TV+ service. The company is reportedly looking for an executive to lead the initiative, and it's started buying original podcasts that are spinoffs of current Apple TV+ content, as well as podcasts that could be adapted into future Apple TV+ content.

Podcasts may never produce much of a profit for Apple, but the company can use podcasts to drive adoption of Apple TV+, which could eventually become a big moneymaker. However, Apple remains at a disadvantage to other streaming services that already have vast troves of content. Competing effectively will likely require many billions in content spending annually.

Shares of Apple were roughly flat Friday morning. The stock is less than 4% below its 52-week high."

Here are five things you must know for Monday, May 18:

1. -- Stock Futures Point Sharply Higher

Stock futures were posting solid gains Monday after investors cheered the reopening of the U.S. economy and after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell expressed optimism the country can begin to rebound in the second half of 2020.

Stock futures also were getting a lift from positive study results on Moderna's (MRNA) - Get Report coronavirus vaccine candidate.

Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 477 points, futures for the S&P 500 rose 55 points and Nasdaq futures gained 145 points.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said about 75% of the state's economy had reopened, while Apple (AAPL) - Get Report said more than 25 stores in the U.S. and 12 stores in Canada would reopen this week after being forced to close by the coronavirus pandemic.

Paul Chew, head of research at Phillip Securities in Singapore, told The Wall Street Journal that as economies emerge from lockdowns, stocks would tend to creep higher. He added that a stronger rally would come only when investors believed there was a decreased risk of a big second wave of infections.

Stocks on Friday closed out their biggest weekly loss in nearly two months. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% for the week.

2. -- Fed Chief Sees Gradual U.S. Recovery

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the United States can expect a gradual and likely bumpy recovery as lockdowns are lifted during the coronavirus pandemic but added a full-blown sequel to the Great Depression isn't likely.

""The big thing we have to avoid,"" said Powell, in an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, ""is a second wave of the virus.""

The Fed chief said the recovery process could run through to the end of 2021 - ""it'll be a while before we really feel well recovered,"" he said - and added that the only path to a sure recovery will be a vaccine.

“For the economy to fully recover people will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine,” he said.

The U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, leads the world in the number of coronavirus cases, at 1,486,752, and deaths at 89,564.

Assuming the U.S. can somehow escape a second wave of the coronavirus, it will see the economy recover steadily through the second half of 2020 after a potential peak jobless rate of up to 25% and dramatic shrinkage of gross domestic product, the Fed chairman said in the interview.

3. -- Walmart, Home Depot, Nvidia Report Earnings This Week

The earnings calendar this week includes reports from Walmart (WMT) - Get Report, Home Depot (HD) - Get Report, Kohl's (KSS) - Get Report, Lowe's (LOW) - Get Report, Target (TGT) - Get Report, Nvidia (NVDA) - Get Report, TJX Cos. (TJX) - Get Report, Best Buy (BBY) - Get Report, Nordstrom (JWN) - Get Report, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - Get Report, Alibaba (BABA) - Get Report and Deere (DE) - Get Report.

Highlights of the economic calendar this week include Housing Starts on Tuesday, minutes of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday, and Jobless Claims and the Philadelphia Fed Business Outlook Survey on Thursday.

4. -- SoftBank Posts Massive Loss, Jack Ma Resigns From Board

SoftBank, the Japanese tech conglomerate, posted an annual operating loss of $13 billion and said it would withhold its dividend as its Vision Fund lost nearly $18 billion after writing down the value of investments in WeWork and Uber Technologies.

The loss is the worst in the company’s 39-year history, according to Bloomberg.

SoftBank also announced the departure of Alibaba founder Jack Ma from its board after 13 years.

The company also said it would buy back nearly $5 billion of its own stock by March 2021. The repurchase is similar in size to one it announced in mid-March.

5. -- J.C. Penney Files for Bankruptcy

J.C. Penney (JCP) - Get Report formally filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday, becoming the third major U.S. retailer to fall victim to the coronavirus pandemic and ongoing economic shutdown.

The bankruptcy filing, which was announced after the stock markets closed, ended a tumultuous two months for the retailer, which was already struggling under more than $3.8 billion in debt when it shuttered its portfolio of 850 stores and head office in mid-March.

J.C. Penney, in business for 118 years, skipped two debt payments in the last month, though it said it made a $17 million interest payment on a loan, avoiding default. The company last week reportedly was locking in $450 million in financing to navigate chapter 11."

Sharp, which makes sensors, camera modules and screens for Apple's iPhones, said operating profit came in at 52.7 billion yen ($491 million) for the year ended in March, falling for the second consecutive year. The company, a unit of Taiwan's Foxconn, flagged the weak annual profit earlier this month as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted its supply chains for display panels and other components.

Now, let’s see if investors might want to buy PLAN stock with the cloud-based planning software firm set to report its first quarter fiscal 2021 financial results before the market opens on Tuesday, May 26.

The Basics

Anaplan, as its name might suggest, develops cloud-based, enterprise-level SaaS platforms to help enable real-time planning and decision-making. The company currently boasts over 1,400 customers around the world, and PLAN topped our Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. Anaplan’s fiscal 2020 sales surged 45% and it cut its adjusted loss per from -$0.73 down to -$0.44.

As we mentioned at the top, PLAN stock has skyrocketed 80% over the last two months. Overall, Anaplan shares are up over 100% since the firm went public in October 2018. And despite the recent run, which crushes Facebook FB, Zoom ZM, Apple AAPL, and other high-flyers, PLAN stock still sits nearly 20% off its 52-week highs. This could give it plenty of room to run if it’s able to impress Wall Street.

Outlook

Our current Zacks estimates call for Anaplan’s Q1 revenue to jump 35% to reach $102.3 million. Meanwhile, its full-year fiscal 2021 sales are projected to climb 30%, with FY22 expected to come in another 28% higher to hit $577.32 million.

Alongside its projected sustained revenue growth, Anaplan is expected to post a slightly smaller adjusted loss in Q1, at -$0.14 a share against the year-ago period’s -$0.16. PLAN’s adjusted FY21 loss is expected to remain nearly the same. Then the tech firm’s adjusted full-year fiscal 2022 loss is projected to be nearly cut in half at -$0.25 a share.

Bottom Line

Anaplan is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) right now that has easily topped our quarterly earnings estimates in the trailing four periods. On top of that, PLAN is part of an industry that rests in the top 12% of our more than 250 Zacks industries.

In the end, playing stocks for near-term gains around earnings is risky. But longer-term investors who are looking for growth within tech might want to consider Anaplan, as it trades at $50 a share.

Trump tweeted about the 'massive disinformation' campaign China is running in the U.S. and Europe about their role in spreading the coronavirus pandemic. On Mad Money, Jim Cramer said that stocks are down because the administration is getting tough on China again and the weakening economy is not to blame for today's slump.

TheStreet's Katherine Ross spoke with Cramer yesterday about Apple and Tesla competing in the tech sector, Expedia optimistic outlook on travel and why the jobless claims aren't having the impact on the stock market as many would think.

Are Apple and Tesla Competitors?

If you were offered 100 shares at the current prices of either Apple AAPL or Tesla TSLA and were forced to hold the shares you pick for 10 years without trading them before receiving the net profit, would you pick Apple or Tesla? This hypothetical question comes up because Morgan Stanley's Katy Huberty said tech investors believe Tesla is Apple 20 years ago and although many investors see them as potential partners, Huberty believes they are competitors. Could that be an accurate future for the two?

Cramer responds to Huberty's comments on the two giants in the stock market.

Is Expedia in Trouble After Lockdowns Ease?

Very few industries have been hit harder than the travel industry during the coronavirus pandemic. Full flights will be a thing in the past, for the time being, hotels will have that vacancy lit for a while, and traveling abroad might have to wait for countries to ease their borders to foreign tourists. Expedia EXPE reported earnings this week and said they are already seeing strength in bookings as Americans look to leave their homes following quarantine.

Could Expedia come back stronger than before coronavirus or is Expedia full of hot air? Cramer weighs in on Expedia and the travel industry in this market.

Jobless Claims Is Being Ignored

Jobless claims extended another 2.4 million this past week. The total jobless claims for the last nine weeks is almost 39 million and although the number is going down each week, what does this mean for the stock market. Will the total jobless claims impact the markets in the near term or will the stock market continue ticking higher?

Cramer explains what impact the jobless claims have on the market and what to expect moving forward.

Stop worrying about the shape of the recovery and stay focused on the size of the decline, Jim Cramer cautioned his Mad Money viewers Tuesday. While the possibility of a second Great Depression may be fading in the distance, our economy isn't out of danger yet.

It's still possible that we've not seen the bottom of this economic drop and millions more layoffs are still ahead. That means investors must stay vigilant, investing in companies that thrive in the new COVID-19 world. Facebook (FB) - Get Report has proven itself a winner, with a renewed focus on small business. Apple (AAPL) - Get Report and Netflix (NFLX) - Get Report remain crowd favorites. Finally, there's the king of stay-at-home stocks, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report, which has rallied 32% for the year.

Cramer said he was encouraged by Walmart's (WMT) - Get Report comments signaling pent up demand and suggesting that perhaps April was the bottom. But while oil has bottomed and the financials are not seeing sizable defaults, much of the market's recent rally has been fueled by hopes of a vaccine. That vaccine is likely still a long way off.

Cramer and the AAP team are looking at everything from earnings and tariffs to the Federal Reserve. Find out what they're telling their investment club members and get in on the conversation with a free trial subscription to Action Alerts Plus.

Reward Small Business

Small business has been billed as the backbone of the U.S. economy, and for good reason. While big business is focused on cutting costs and boosting their bottom line, small businesses tend to spend and keep lots of people employed.

But in a world of layoffs and quarantine, the backbone of America isn't getting ripped out, it's just moving online. Cramer said there's a growing wave of micro-businesses blossoming, ones that use Etsy (ETSY) - Get Report Shopify (SHOP) - Get Report and Wix (WIX) - Get Report to sell artisanal goods direct to consumers and deliver them right to their homes.

This trend may still be small today, Cramer said, but it's catching on as small businesses shift from stores to online to avoid landlords and unnecessary overhead. Cramer told viewers to keep their eye on this underreported segment of our new economy.

Off the Charts

In the ""Off The Charts"" segment, Cramer checked in with colleague Carolyn Boroden for the latest read on where the markets are heading next. Boroden correctly warned the markets were vulnerable in February and called the March lows a month later.

Using a daily chart of the S&P 500, Boroden saw a mixed picture, with the average needed to pass a ceiling of resistance at its 200-day moving average around 3,000. If the index can clear that ceiling, Boroden's price targets were 3,720 and 4,136. She cautioned that investors need to be ready to sell, however, if the breakout doesn't occur.

The daily chart of the Nasdaq painted a stronger picture, with the index already above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Boroden's price target was 9,489, but here again, if we fail to rally and decline below last week's lows, it will be a bearish sign.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 followed similar patterns, with several ceilings needing to be cleared in the short term before a continuation of the rally is possible. Boroden urged caution if the major averages cannot rise above these key resistance levels.

Executive Decision: Ping Identity

In his first ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer spoke with Andre Durand, CEO of Ping Identity (PING) - Get Report, the cybersecurity company with shares that are up only slightly for the year.

Durand explained that Ping provides identity management services for 60 out of the Fortune 100 companies, allowing employees to access their company's network from any device no matter where they are. Ping Identity connects the users to the right applications even when they're working from home.

Ping Identity was born in the enterprise, Durand added, which means they're focused on scale, performance and security for customers that have hundreds of millions of transactions per day. Ping provides these enterprise customers with mission critical functionality as well as the tools they need to secure and manage their network assets.

When asked whether the work-from-home trend was here to stay, Durand said Ping Identity has always believed that remote work was a growing trend and this pandemic has only accelerated that.

Executive Decision: Five9

For his second ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer also spoke with Rowan Trollope, CEO of Five9 (FIVN) - Get Report, the contact center provider with shares hitting new all-time highs this month.

Trollope explained that Five9 is a digital platform that connects businesses to their customers via chat, SMS and telephone. The system is web-based, which makes it flexible for agents to work from home or from anywhere.

At a time when many businesses have their physical locations closed, Five9's platform acts as the new front door. Many companies are finding that this new digital front door provides a better experience than the old way.

Trollope said when Five9 surveyed their customers, 75% said they planned to continue to leverage remote workers after the pandemic. They found Five9's solutions cheaper, more flexible and gave them access to better talent given they were no longer constrained by their local geography.

At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, we believe electric vehicles and energy storage are set to become giant markets, and we want to take advantage of the declining lithium prices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. So we asked astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson about Tesla, Elon Musk, and his top stock picks. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to take a peek at the recent hedge fund action encompassing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

54,Why The Survival Of Traditional Carmakers Is Far From Certain,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgSKSUcte9AYA_ibQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBya2cwZmh2BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM1BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411795/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.investing.com%2fanalysis%2fwhy-the-survival-of-traditional-carmakers-is-far-from-certain-200525047/RK=2/RS=c1nf.ZsQsiRfADewBbnp3VEQ3pI-,None,"This article is a small part of a 11-part analysis of Tesla, Elon Musk, and the EV industry by value investor Vitaliy Katsenelson. You can see the complete analysis here or here

Let’s go back to June 2008, when Apple (NASDAQ: ) introduced the iPhone 3G and Nokia (NYSE: ) was still the world’s largest phone maker. What we did not know at the time was that Nokia was actually the largest dumb phone maker and that Apple was about to become the largest smartphone maker — a crucially important nuance.

Technological Change vs Domain Shift

In 2004, Nokia missed the flip phone boom and lost market share to Motorola (NYSE: ), which came out with the slick Razr flip phone. Nokia had a few quarters of disappointing sales, the stock declined, and we bought it. But then Nokia came out with its own flip phone and the status quo was restored: the company was again the king of the dumb phone castle. The flip phone was a technological change, but it was still in Nokia’s domain of core competency. We sold the stock and made money.

The mistake many investors made, including yours truly, was missing the fact that the iPhone was not a technological change like the flip phone, but shift into a very different domain with a very different ecosystem. It was not a phone, but a portable computer that also made phone calls. Nokia should’ve thanked Apple for showing the future of the phone and developed its own smartphone, but it didn’t. So Apple did not dethrone Nokia; Nokia did it to itself.

Which brings us to Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and traditional carmakers. In theory, nobody knows more about making cars than the traditional internal-combustion-engine (ICE) carmakers, and so EVs made by these companies should be the ones busying our streets a decade from now. But the transition from ICE cars to EVs is not just a technological shift within a domain, like the transition from two-wheel-drive sedans to four-wheel-drive SUVs. This is a radical shift into a new domain and the success of ICE car manufacturers in this new domain is anything but guaranteed.

ICE cars are dumb phones; Tesla’s Model 3 is an iPhone 3G. Cars last about 12 years and phones two to three, so this transition will happen slowly.

Why Domain Shifts Are Tricky Business

In domain shifts, assets turn into liabilities. Nokia in 2008 was a master of hardware, but not software or user interface. It tried to respond to the iPhone by remolding its dumb-phone Symbian OS into a smartphone OS. That attempt failed miserably.

That’s because when you are in the middle of a transition from one domain to another, your knowledge of the past domain may cloud your vision. You’ll be seeing through the lenses you’re used to wearing.

Established companies also need the capacity and ability to suffer (lose money) to survive a domain shift. In 1997, Barnes & Noble (NYSE: ) sold more books in a day than Amazon (NASDAQ: ) did in months. But to snuff out Amazon, B&N would’ve had to lower its prices and hurt its very profitable business. We all know how that story ended.

Another example: Walmart (NYSE: ). As it’s trying to catch up to Amazon in online sales, Walmart needs to invest—and invest a lot. To do just that, the company is currently losing $1 billion (a tiny fraction of its profits) on online sales, but the company’s board and CEO Greg Foran are not very happy about . This is a company that never lost money before. Losses are not in its DNA, but they are Jeff Bezos’ middle name. To make things more complicated, Foran’s bonus is tied to profits of both online and offline stores.

You can see how difficult it is even for a company as dominant and successful as Walmart to adapt to a shift in domain.

Nokia or Samsung?

Nokia wasn’t the only dumb phone maker at the time of iPhone’s release. There was also Samsung (OTC: ). Unlike Nokia, it successfully transitioned into one of the biggest smartphone makers today. So, established companies can and do transition during a domain shift.

But what about ICE carmakers? Are they going to go the way of Nokia, or the way of Samsung?

Tesla created its cars by entirely breaking out of the domain of existing auto manufacturers (well, except for the original Roadster). Because it created the EV industry, Tesla had the advantage of acting from first principles. It could start with a blank piece of paper. As Musk once told an interviewer:

“I tend to approach things from a physics framework … physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.”

This first-principles approach allowed Tesla to build EVs that are free from the limitations of gasoline-car thinking. No gears, a skateboard chassis, two engines, a “frunk,” a credit-card key, a mobile app that works as a key and controls the car, and no start button, among others. Tesla applied first-principles thinking to how its cars would be sold and serviced.

Today’s ICE auto manufacturers are basically wholesalers of their cars to auto dealers that are their franchisees. This business model is a Great Depression relic that went basically unchallenged until Tesla came along. Tesla decided that the traditional business model was not appropriate for the new EV domain. Instead, it borrowed from Apple, which controls the full customer experience, from buying a phone to servicing it to upgrading to a new one.

Consider: My purchase of a $51,000 Model 3 was as easy as my purchase of a $900 iPhone. I test drove the car. A few days later, I called the Tesla store and told the salesperson I wanted to buy it. My information was already in the system. A few days later, I got an email confirming the delivery date and asking me to schedule a pickup time. One morning this past June, I showed up for my car at 9:30 a.m. — 10 minutes later I was driving home. It was that simple.

Tesla changed how a car is serviced, too. A few weeks after I bought the Model 3, its speakerphone stopped working. I went into the Tesla iPhone app and requested service. I was given a choice between bringing my car to the Tesla service center or having a service technician come to me. I chose the latter. Two days later, the technician showed up at my office. I gave him my car key and went back to work. An hour later my car was fixed. Tesla’s technician had simply restarted my computer. In hindsight, I could have called Tesla and my speakerphone issue could have been fixed remotely.

Now compare this experience with buying and servicing an ICE car. It is difficult for traditional car companies to adapt first-principles thinking, as it requires them to unlearn what made them successful in the old domain. They are going to have to retool their factories and go through a significant and painful change of their workforce. Their current employees have a different skill set and look at the world through petrochemical lenses (one reason perhaps why General Motors's (NYSE: ) initial foray into EVs was the Chevrolet Volt, an electric car with a gasoline engine).

Auto dealers, an asset to car companies today, are tomorrow’s liabilities, as Tesla’s direct distribution and service model should provide a cost advantage once it gets to scale. Tesla’s model is more customer-friendly and efficient, allowing the company to capture the profit that ICE carmakers share with their dealers. Because a good number of Tesla’s cars are built to order, the company doesn’t need massive inventory sitting on parking lots. Moreover, ICE manufacturers may not be able to replicate Tesla’s direct-sales business model because they are stuck with the franchise agreements they signed with their dealers.

But while it won’t be easy for ICE carmakers to adapt first-principles thinking to their EVs, they may not need to: they can just copy Tesla, as Nokia should have done with Apple. William Durant, who turned struggling Buick into General Motors, originally made his millions on horse-drawn carriages. Samsung did a great job of copying the iPhone with Google’s help; instead of developing its own operating system, Samsung used Google’s Android.

Given the enormity of the needed investment, carmakers are creating alliances. Ford (NYSE: ) and Volkswagen (OTC: ), for instance, are working together on artificial intelligence (AI) and skateboard chassis for EVs. Historically, such alliances in the auto industry have had mixed success.

Traditional car companies do have strengths in designing, assembling, and marketing cars. They use legions of suppliers to make the parts that go into their cars. They can do the same thing when it comes to EVs. They can outsource the battery to LG or Samsung. They can outsource software design to the likes of Cognizant (NASDAQ: ) and DXC (NYSE: ) (we own both of these stocks in our portfolios). They can use Waymo (NASDAQ: ) self-driving software and NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: ) self-driving hardware. Plus, traditional automakers are in their best financial shape in decades and have capital to finance the EV adventure. They can afford to make an enormous investment in EV and absorb the losses that come with them. But will they?

To some degree, their job is more difficult than Tesla’s. They have to keep innovating as they make ICE cars because ICE cars pay their bills. At the same time, they have to focus on the future and invest enormous amounts of time and capital into EVs.

For ICE automakers to succeed in electric vehicles, they should set up separate EV units with management reporting to the board of directors. The EV management team should be given a blank check, equity in the new company, and the ability to hire people from inside and, most important, outside of the company. The existing ICE business should be run with a focus not on growth but on maximizing cash flows.

It is easy for me to write this, but it will be very difficult to do, considering that these companies will need to introduce new, exciting cars every four years and entice consumers to buy them, just to keep financing their losses on EVs.

56,Facebook Shops Should Boost Its E-Commerce Ad Sales,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgSKSUcte9AYAAyfQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411795/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.thestreet.com%2finvesting%2ffacebook-shops-should-boost-e-commerce-ad-sales/RK=2/RS=giFlIY_s0wC4hyopcJv87eyl2A0-,2020-05-20 19:40:39+00:00,"The social media giant is betting that its Facebook Shop platform will give merchants an incentive to spend more on Facebook and Instagram ads.

Facebook’s (FB) - Get Report newest tools for helping businesses sell on its platforms should strengthen an e-commerce ad business that has been a bright spot for the company during the current downturn.

Unlike existing Facebook tools for merchants that work specifically on either the core Facebook platform or Instagram, the Facebook Shops service, which was unveiled on Tuesday, lets businesses set up digital storefronts that can be viewed on both platforms.

Businesses can showcase items from their catalogs, while promoting them via Facebook/Instagram business pages, stores services and ads. Facebook is also giving businesses the ability to receive messages via WhatsApp, Messenger and the Instagram Direct service, and the option to support Facebook and Instagram’s in-app checkout features in the U.S. Presumably, the cross-platform Facebook Pay service, which was unveiled last November, will be supported in time.

Facebook also announced that it’s rolling out Instagram Shop, a dedicated shopping section within the Instagram app, this summer in the U.S. And taking a page from Chinese e-commerce apps, Facebook plans to give businesses the ability to tag products from their catalogs when promoting them via live streams.

True to recent form, markets have responded favorably to Facebook's announcements. Facebook's stock is up 8% over the last two trading days, and has made new highs.

Facebook's moves come at a time when e-commerce activity has spiked thanks to a combination of COVID-19 fears, retail store closures, stimulus payments and lower discretionary spending on dining, travel and entertainment.

They also come three weeks after CFO Dave Wehner indicated on Facebook’s Q1 earnings call that healthy e-commerce, tech and gaming ad sales had allowed Facebook’s ad revenue to remain roughly flat on an annual basis, in spite of major declines in verticals such as travel and auto. Later, Mark Zuckerberg added that Facebook wants to accelerate its e-commerce product development efforts, in order to better support small businesses that want to begin selling online.

However, as Facebook’s 2019 unveiling of Facebook Pay, Instagram checkouts and its Libra cryptocurrency initiative drive home, Zuckerberg's interest in driving more commerce activity on his company’s platforms predates COVID-19. In an early-January Facebook post, Zuckerberg asserted that he wants to integrate Facebook’s payments and commerce tools so that “anyone can sell products through a storefront on Instagram, message and support their customers through Messenger, or send money home to another country instantly and at low cost through WhatsApp.”

By and large, Facebook isn’t looking to profit from such efforts by collecting payment fees or taking a commission on e-commerce transactions. Rather, the company is betting that these moves increase the number of businesses that have an incentive to buy Facebook ads to promote products, and more broadly improve conversion rates for Facebook’s e-commerce ads (and by doing so, motivate advertisers large and small to spend more on them).

In addition, to the extent that they drive greater usage of Facebook’s checkout services, these efforts give the company more shopping transaction data that it can leverage for ad targeting. That could be particularly valuable at a time when Facebook has cautioned that its targeting abilities will be impacted in the near-term by new privacy regulations, Apple (AAPL) - Get Report and Alphabet/Google’s (GOOG) - Get Report attempts to limit data-collection on their respective browsers and operating systems and Facebook’s own rollout of new privacy controls.

Facebook, it’s worth noting, isn’t the only major tech company that’s currently trying to roll out new solutions for connecting consumers with online merchants.

A month ago, Google announced that its Google Shopping website, which to date has only featured paid placements, will also support free product listings. And a week later, Shopify (SHOP) - Get Report unveiled Shop, an app that lets consumers browse products sold by merchants using Shopify’s software/services platform.

57,Here's Why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Has Lagged the S&P 500 (and Why It Could Have Been Worse),https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCCXUcteYzUA4QzQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByb2lvbXVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411799/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f21%2fwhy-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-lagged-sp500.aspx/RK=2/RS=pHMgOX7fBzP6BQnUgkbWTiYMAAQ-,2020-05-21 00:00:00,"The past three months have been brutal for the stock market. Even with the 35% gain the S&P 500 had made since its March 23 low, the broad large-cap index remains 13% below its Feb. 19 peak. And doubts about the rally's longevity continue to swirl.

Things have been even worse for owners of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), believe it or not. Though there's no denying Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett has earned his title as the Oracle of Omaha, his approach to stock-picking was particularly vulnerable to the highly unusual conditions that have prevailed since late February when the market began to recognize the potential economic damage the COVID-19 pandemic could cause in the United States. Namely, Berkshire's lack of sector diversification among its biggest stock holdings has severely hurt shareholders, driving the fund to a year-to-date loss of 24%. The fund just hasn't benefited as much from the partial recovery many other stocks began to make in March, as its largest equity positions are within the sectors that have been the hardest hit since March.

Berkshire isn't just a collection of stocks, of course. The fund is also made up of dozens of privately held companies including Duracell (yes, the batteries), GEICO auto insurance, and See's Candies just to name a few. These 63 companies continue to operate -- and generate cash flow -- in an environment that in some cases may have done more damage to stock prices than the underlying businesses themselves. GEICO, its BNSF rail line, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and other owned businesses like its reinsurance unit contributed pre-tax operating income of $6.8 billion for Berkshire Hathway's quarter ending in March.

Still, the lack of diversification among its top stock holdings is greater than the lack of diversification among its outright owned businesses. These privately held outfits span several sectors ranging from manufacturing to transportation to all sorts of consumer goods to materials to utilities to insurance. No single one of these privately held entities accounted for more than one-fourth of the income produced by Berkshire's own businesses during the first quarter. Ditto for any particular sector represented by these names. And, even among the biggest of these private companies, all but one chipped in less than 10% of its total privately produced profits. Most contributed considerably less.

In other words, any diversity-related performance problems plaguing Berkshire of late mostly stems from an over-concentrated stock portfolio.

Berkshire Hathaway's diversification problem

One of Warren Buffett's oft-repeated nuggets of wisdom is ""invest in what you know,"" meaning if you don't understand how a company makes money, steer clear of its stock because you also won't understand when it's about to stop making money. In line with that philosophy, Berkshire Hathaway holds stakes in a number of banks and consumer staples names -- two industries that have been within Buffett's wheelhouse of expertise for quite some time.

It's arguable, however, that Berkshire now owns a little too much of what Buffett knows so well.

The table below lays out Berkshire's 10 biggest stock holdings as of the end of March. It now owns around $175 billion worth of investments in 50 different stocks. But, these 10 largest positions make up nearly 85% of the $175 billion total. As such, these 10 holdings are going to make an exaggerated impact on Berkshire Hathaway's performance, even if its performance is somewhat steadied by the presumed value of its privately held, cash-generating businesses.

Company Sector Value as of

March 31 % of Stock

Portfolio Performance

Since Feb. 19 Apple NASDAQ:AAPL) Consumer $62.3 billion 35.5% (2.5%) Bank of America NYSE:BAC) Financial $19.6 billion 11.2% (34.5%) Coca-Cola NYSE:KO) Staples $17.7 billion 10.1% (24.5%) American Express NYSE:AXP) Financial $13 billion 7.4% (35.4%) Wells Fargo & Co. NYSE:WFC) Financial $9.28 billion 5.3% (46.7%) Kraft Heinz Co.

N/A $130 billion N/A N/A S&P 500 N/A N/A N/A (12.7%)

It doesn't take more than a cursory glance to realize this investment pool of equities is loaded with financial stocks. Among the 10 biggest positions alone, banks and brokers account for 32.5% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio value. Bank of America by itself makes up more than 11% of it. Consumer staples make up nearly another 15% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio, just counting the two staples names within the top 10. Coca-Cola itself was one-tenth of the pool's total value as of the end of March.

It matters now more than it normally might. Both sectors have been severe underperformers since the market hit a wall in February. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT:XLF), which broadly represents the financial sector, is down 29% since Feb. 19 and was down as much as 43% in late March. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSEMKT:XLP) is only down about 10% from its Feb. 19 peak, but Coca-Cola hasn't participated in that recovery. It's down 25%, as the company has found itself highly vulnerable to the circumstances created by the coronavirus. Kraft Heinz has done well, but remember, Kraft Heinz's poor performance has haunted Buffett since 2017.

Then there's the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the room -- Apple. It's back to within 3% of its Feb. 19 peak, almost fully recovering what at one point was a 31% plunge. In this light, it's actually a good thing that one stock alone makes up more than a third of Berkshire Hathaway's total stock portfolio as of the end of March. That strength has prevented the fund's performance from being considerably worse than it might have otherwise been of late.

Nevertheless, investors who are being intellectually honest with themselves have to concede this degree of concentration defies the logic and spirit of constructing a diversified portfolio. Buffett and his people may well ""know"" Apple, justifying the oversized position, but deep knowledge of a company doesn't inherently prevent its stock from unexpectedly tumbling.

The big takeaway

Fans of Buffett might push back against the idea, suggesting his long-term performance has earned him the right to break investing rules mostly intended to keep less-experienced and less-skilled investors out of trouble. Those fans will also rightfully point out Berkshire's wholly-owned businesses like BNSF, Acme Brick Co., and Lubrizol avoid the stock price-related volatility that has made conventional funds and ETFs uncomfortably volatile in recent weeks. While these privately owned entities don't have a clear market value the way a publicly traded company does, they still have value. Investors just have to estimate what their aggregate value might be in order to appropriately price Berkshire Hathaway shares in the open market.

To that end, while the fund's 10 biggest holdings make up around 85% of Berkshire's stock holdings, an educated guess suggests these 10 may also make up less than half the value of Berkshire's entire investment portfolio.

Even so, the financial sector remains over-represented among all of Berkshire's holdings. Publicly traded banks, as well as privately held insurers, are in similarly tough situations right now. The fund is also still very exposed to the consumer staples sector. Aside from public entities like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, privately held See's Candies, Nebraska Furniture Mart, Dairy Queen, Ben Bridge Jewelers, Pampered Chef, Fruit of the Loom, and several other consumer-facing outfits that Berkshire owns hit the same wall in March. As a whole, there's still not as much sector diversity within all of Berkshire's holdings that a typical investor might prefer.

There's another not-so-small nuance that must be injected into the conversation. That is, Buffett doesn't have to worry about growing a nest egg to spend during retirement. Dividends alone can offer him plenty of cash flow in his golden years to provide him a very nice retirement (one of the perks of being a billionaire). The rest of us do have to worry about such things, however. Some prospective retirees have already postponed their last planned workday due to COVID-19, in fact. Investors who have put significant fractions of their holdings into Berkshire Hathaway may have to move their planned retirement dates a little further down the road than other investors will have to. Berkshire's staples and financial holdings will eventually recover, but they've been banged up quite a bit, suggesting that they'll have a longer road to travel en route to recovery.

Bottom line? Just make sure your portfolio allocation makes sense for your particular situation, and not Warren Buffett's."

Ready to go? Station wagon all packed up. Where are we headed? Somewhere nicer than this. We hope. Either Mom or Dad will drive. They'll probably take turns. We kids in the back will start out reading. When we get bored, we'll ask Mom and Dad if we are almost ""there"" more time than they will have patience for. Then we'll ask one time too many times. After that we'll probably look out the window, and wonder. Wonder about the people who live in between here and there. Wonder about the lives of the trucker headed the other way, or about the family that just sped by. We don't know. We have no choice but to allow the story of this road trip to unfold.

Thursday starts out as ""Flash PMI"" day. The numbers across Europe are quite awful. That said, for the most part, the May flash for both manufacturing and services appears to show a slowing in the pace of aggressively collapsing economic activity across the region. Is that good? No. Is it better than terrible? Maybe not even that. Is it better than worst case? After what we now know.. maybe we'll give you that last one. European economies are trying to reopen in stages. That offers the prospect of increased velocity in transaction. If one has been sitting down for months, a walk around the block is seen as quite active.

The state of Connecticut made the move toward getting some businesses open on Wednesday. That makes it unanimous. All 50 U.S. states have now relaxed at least some restrictions, as the economic carnage has become all too real, even to the most scarred among us. Notice, I wrote scarred, not scared. While there are regions in this vast land that think the negative impacts of the coronavirus are perhaps overblown, there are other regions that weep, because it is real to them. Still, some velocity of money is an improvement when that velocity has hovered just above ""zero"" for two months.

What Day Is It?

Not knowing what day it is has become a common social media meme among those whose jobs have been claimed by the shut-down of entire economies. Then there are those working remotely, who have felt the need to prove their ability to maintain or even increase personal levels of productivity, as they feel the breath of economic despair down their necks. Neither is healthy.

I speak almost daily, as the economy has reopened in small ways, to essential workers who must deal with the public, terrified that one day they bring home an unwelcome extra to their families. I also speak close to daily with a local accountant, who is working harder than ever. Most of this individual's clients are also small businesses. Most of them are unable to pay their bills, unable to pay this individual's bill. Talk about uncertainty.

Still, equity markets rallied -- and rallied quite hard on Wednesday. Gap filled? No. Gap unfilled. The virus is still in charge? Yes, but not just the virus alone. Monday, stocks rallied on positive vaccine news per the Moderna (MRNA) release. Tuesday, stocks sold off per the Stat news article that covered the Moderna release. Wednesday, stocks once again popped: One because economies are starting to move.. a little. Two, because there was once again positive news regarding a developing vaccine candidate.

This time, it was Inovio (INO) . That firm's candidate, INO-4800 has apparently shown a ""robust neutralizing antibody and immune system response"" in mice and guinea pigs in this fight against Covid-19. I don't know how many Real Money readers also read the piece in Forbes by Nathan Vardi on Pfizer's (PFE) efforts toward rapidly getting to a solution, but the article in my opinion is both a worthy and interesting read. Communities of scientists are working aggressively toward turning this awful page in our history. Markets are ahead of the real economy on this, but are overtly stretched valuations justified? I sure hope so. We all hope so.

Interesting

The Nasdaq Composite scored more than a 2% increase on Wednesday, closing not too far from the day's highs. This index that, incredibly, closed just 4.7% short of a new all-time high, was led to the upside for the day by... wait for it... Internet names and semiconductor stocks. The rally was broader than that, though. The S&P 500 muddled through a more-pedestrian gain of 1.7% as all 11 sectors managed to shade green. Trading volume increased in aggregate for constituent members of both of these broader large-cap indices, on decisively positive breadth.

These are positives for sure. The Fed Minutes -- always three weeks behind, usually offer little in the way of useful input in a news cycle that evolves not even by the day, but by the minute -- actually reinforced the idea that the central bank stands ready to do monetarily whatever it can to support economic conditions, even in the face of a potential for increased outbreaks of infection.

Investors already knew that Powell had their backs, but it never hurts to hear it again. There is no doubt that what the Fed has done has at least smoothed market function while pressuring borrowing costs. Even as not all of the planned actions have yet to take shape. This is key, as many businesses must replace cash flow with debt out of necessity. That story likely leads the nation toward the path of yield curve control as a method of both policy implementation and forward guidance. Not there yet, but this is out there, even if results have been less than spectacular where such policy had already been in place, pre-public health crisis.

Weak Spots

The deterioration of the geopolitical condition between the U.S. and China has only grown in recent days. One can imagine that this relationship might become a campaign issue, unless this issue is one where both sides of the aisle in D.C. actually find common ground. Readers surely noticed the weakness experienced across U.S.-listed Chinese stocks on Wednesday, as the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed, in bipartisan fashion, a bill on Wednesday that would force foreign-held corporations listing in the U.S. to meet the same accounting standards that U.S. domiciled corporations are held to. In addition, these firms would be required to certify that they themselves are not ""owned or controlled by a foreign government.""

Was the Wednesday reaction a bit much? Probably. Prior to delisting, these firms would have three years to get themselves into compliance, and for the most part, these stocks did close off of their lows for the day. Two takeaways here. One, the Trump administration has not yet endorsed this bill, and two, Alibaba Group (BABA) reports on Friday morning. It will be interesting to see if anything is said at that time around these developments.

Domestically, according to TransUnion (credit card reporting business), almost 15M credit card accounts had entered into financial hardship programs as of April. This was reported Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal along with news that a near 3M auto loans had entered similar programs. These programs allow consumers to temporarily cease making payments during times of hardship. According to the Journal, these numbers amount to 3% of credit card accounts and 3.5% of auto loans, up from 0.03% of credit card accounts and 0.5% of auto loans from April 2019.

What that means simply put is that even as economies reopen, the consumer will not be there as before. Businesses may open, at reduced capacity. As long as unheard-of levels of unemployment, underemployment and plain old fear persist, the economy cannot grow beyond a certain point. When this shows up in commercial real estate is probably as soon as that data starts coming in, in some detail.

See This?

Hard to miss. The world's two dominant providers of smartphone operating systems, Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) jointly released their new technology on Wednesday that would, if broadly adopted, notify users if someone that the individual had come into contact with (and also having adopted the technology) had tested positive for this coronavirus. The system would use Bluetooth signals to make this happen.

The big question is just how much privacy individuals are willing to give up in order to gain access to such knowledge. Already, according to the Wall Street Journal, 22 nations and several U.S. states have requested access to this technology, which would be used to augment existing means of tracking and tracing community spread of the virus. This story develops as we move forward.

Breakout !!

Facebook (FB) . Always finding a way. Always on the cutting edge of ""what's next?"" In the past, I have often not been a fan of this firm, but there is no doubt when block-chain-based cryptocurrency was going to be the next big thing, Facebook tried to go there. As Shopify (SHOP) has exploded. As Amazon (AMZN) has become essential, Facebook has noticed.

On Wednesday, the firm announced the launch of ""Facebook Shops"", an e-commerce platform that will allow businesses, perhaps small businesses, to list offerings across the firm's social media services. Obviously, Wall Street liked the idea.

The shares actually broke out from a cup with handle inspired $215 pivot on Tuesday. This was one of those cases, once the news broke, where the pivot acted as a slingshot. The analyst community responded with a series of positive reiterations. Highly rated Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank sees Facebook Shops as a potential $30 billion opportunity. This morning, the also highly rated John Egbert of Stifel Nicolaus set a $260 price target on the shares.

What do I see? The breakout from a technical perspective certainly sets up the possibility of prices in between $240 and $250. Would I buy the shares today? I'll wait for the profit takers first, but this move and this strength are undeniable.

When folks think of the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) portfolio and its collection of holdings, most of which were selected by Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, the companies that most readily come to mind are probably American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and, more recently, Apple (AAPL).

But a deep dive into Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings reveals a more complicated picture.

Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 47 separate stocks as of June 30, according to the most recent regulatory filing (Aug. 14) with the Securities and Exchange Commission - down from 48 in the first quarter of this year, as he dumped USG Corp. (USG). But the portfolio of ""Buffett stocks"" isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Some holdings are so small as to be immaterial leftovers from earlier bets the Oracle of Omaha has yet to completely exit.

And perhaps most importantly, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise 80%. Banks and airlines, to cite a couple of sectors, carry quite a load in this portfolio. Then there's the fact that several Buffett stocks actually were picked by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

Here, we examine each and every holding to give investors a better understanding of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.

Shares held: 59,400

Holding value: $6,134,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.003%

United Parcel Service (UPS, $113.90) might be the world's biggest package delivery company, but it's immaterial when it comes to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. With fewer than 60,000 shares, this is the most meager of Buffett stocks - a rump position, leftovers, an odd lot.

Buffett first invested in UPS in the first quarter of 2006, when he picked up 1.43 million shares worth about $113.5 million. That comes to an average price per share of $79.38.

UPS never was a major part of Berkshire's portfolio, and Buffett has pared the position over the years to where it wouldn't be a surprise if he exited the stake at any time. (Berkshire recently dropped another small holding - telecom giant Verizon (VZ) - in the first quarter of 2019 when he dumped his last 928 shares.)

Although Buffett occasionally can be fairly chatty about some of his more notable stock picks, he typically doesn't comment on BRK.B's buys and sells. There's no mention of United Parcel Service in CNBC's indispensable Warren Buffett archive. But one clue as to why UPS never became a bigger part of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings might be the fact that since March 31, 2006, it has delivered a total return of 110%. But Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generated a total return of 187% in that same time frame.

Translation: UPS has been a bust for BRK.B.

Shares held: 578,000

Holding value: $31,154,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.02%

Berkshire Hathaway's Mondelez (MDLZ, $53.78) holding stems from Buffett's 2007 investment in what was then known as Kraft Foods. The packaged food company changed its name to Mondelez in 2012 after spinning off its North American grocery business, which was called Kraft Foods Group and traded under the ticker KRFT. In 2015, in a deal backed by Buffett, KRFT merged with H.J. Heinz to form Kraft Heinz (KHC).

As we'll see shortly, Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in KHC. As for Mondelez? Not so much. Shares in MDLZ, whose brands include Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers, have underperformed vs. the S&P 500 since the spinoff.

It doesn't sound like Buffett is all that enamored with MDLZ, either. In 2017, he shot down speculation that Kraft Heinz would buy the global snacks giant.

Berkshire Hathaway owns just 0.04% of Mondelez shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. MDLZ accounts for only 0.01% of the total value of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. Nothing to see here, folks.

Shares held: 315,400

Holding value: $34,584,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.02%

Procter & Gamble (PG, $117.39), the consumer products giant and component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is another blue-chip stock that has fallen by the wayside as a Berkshire Hathaway investment.

Buffett came to own P&G - maker of Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers - by dint of the company's 2005 acquisition of razor-maker Gillette. At the time, Buffett, a major Gillette shareholder, called the tie-up a ""dream deal."" P&G became one of BRK.B's biggest equity positions.

That dream didn't last very long. The Great Recession eroded the pricing power of old-line consumer staples companies such as P&G. The company embarked on a plan to shed 100 underperforming brands. The Duracell battery business happened to be on the list, and Berkshire bought it in 2014 in exchange for PG stock. Two years later, Buffett pared what was left of the P&G stake by 99%.

Don't be surprised if Buffett dumps the remaining shares any time now. He's basically out.

Shares held: 327,100

Holding value: $45,558,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.02%

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $130.54), like P&G, is another defensive Dow stock that has fallen out of favor with Buffett. (Kraft Foods, incidentally, also was a Dow stock for a time, from 2008 to 2012.) BRK.B's interest peaked more than a decade ago. Now, the diversified health-care giant represents nothing more than a token holding.

You can blame management missteps. J&J struggled with manufacturing problems and allegations of illegal marketing practices in 2010 and 2011. Buffett was critical of the company for those gaffes, as well as for using too much of its own stock in its 2011 acquisition of device-maker Synthes. Disenchanted with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett dumped most of Berkshire's stake in 2012.

Berkshire's position in JNJ topped out at 64.3 million shares in 2007. Today, the holding company's equity stake comes to just 327,100 shares (about $46 million), which represents less than 0.02% of shares outstanding. Thus, Johnson & Johnson could disappear from the ranks of the Buffett stocks in the near future.

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 2,714,854 / 1,284,020

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $46,777,000 / $22,072,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.03%

Liberty Latin America Class A (LILA, $15.48) and Liberty Latin America Class C (LILAK, $15.55) shares are just the first of several examples of BRK.B essentially betting on legendary pay-TV mogul John Malone.

Liberty Latin America provides cable, broadband, telephone and wireless services in Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America. Liberty Global (LBTYA), the multinational telecommunications company in which Berkshire also holds a stake, issued tracking stock of its Latin American operations in 2015, then spun off those operations entirely in 2018.

As we'll see below, Berkshire has several other investments in Malone-backed enterprises. Malone, a pioneer in the telecom industry and a multibillionaire himself, has created outsize value for shareholders over his long career.

Whether the various investments are Buffett's ideas of those of his portfolio managers, the appeal is plain to understand: Game knows game.

Suncor Energy

Getty Images





Shares held: 10,758,000

Holding value: $335,219,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.16%

Warren Buffett made a move in the energy sector by initiating a position in Suncor Energy (SU, $27.61) in the fourth quarter of 2018. And it's a rarity among Buffett stocks, as it's not U.S.-based.

If this bet on Canada's biggest oil and gas company sounds familiar, it should: This is the second time Berkshire Hathaway has taken a stab at Suncor. The company originally invested in the energy giant in 2013, then sold the entirety of the position three years later. Suncor - an integrated energy giant whose operations span oil sands developments, offshore oil production, biofuels and even wind energy - also sells its refined fuel via a network of more than 1,500 Petro-Canada stations.

Berkshire's stake amounts to just 0.16% of Suncor's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway's only other investment in the energy sector is its position in oil and gas refiner and marketer Phillips 66.

Suncor also is a member of the Canadian Dividend Aristocrats by virtue of having raised its annual dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years.

Teva Pharmaceutical

Getty Images





Shares held: 43,249,295

Holding value: $399,191,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.19%

When Berkshire Hathaway revealed it took a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA, $6.16) in the fourth quarter of 2017, it looked like a classic Warren Buffett value move.

The Israel-based drug manufacturer was out of favor - to put it mildly. A bloated balance sheet, mass layoffs and the looming expiration of drug patents had short sellers licking their chops.

By the time Buffett stepped in, Teva shares were off about 70% from their mid-2015 peak. Berkshire then doubled his stake in Teva during the first quarter of 2018, when shares looked really cheap.

They look even cheaper now. Teva, which has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the start of Q2 2018, trades at just a bit more than 2.5 times analysts' estimates for future earnings - a fraction of the S&P 500's forward P/E. Meanwhile, BRK.B owns 4.3% of Teva's shares outstanding.

StoneCo





Shares held: 14,166,748

Holding value: $419,052,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.20%

Berkshire Hathaway announced in October 2018 that it would take a stake in StoneCo (STNE, $30.52) as the Brazilian financial technology company went public. Given the relatively small position in STNE, and the fact that it's a fintech company, it should come as no surprise that the position was initiated by Buffett lieutenant Todd Combs - with the Oracle of Omaha's blessing, no doubt.

StoneCo, which provides software and hardware for companies to facilitate credit- and debit-card payments, reported a 69% jump in year-over-year second-quarter revenue to 586.2 million Brazilian reals, or $145.1 million, which topped Wall Street estimates. Adjusted net income soared 172% year-over-year to 194.0 million reals, or $48 million.

StoneCo fits well with Berkshire Hathaway's general bullishness on companies that facilitate and process payments. ""Payments are a huge deal worldwide,"" Warren Buffett said at Berkshire's 2018 shareholder meeting.

Phillips 66

Shares held: 5,552,715

Holding value: $519,401,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.25%

After Suncor, Phillips 66 (PSX, $97.47) is Berkshire Hathaway's only other investment in the energy sector. Buffett first bought shares in the oil and gas company in 2012. But despite having heaped praise on PSX in the past, Buffett has dramatically reduced his stake over the past year.

In the first quarter of 2018, he sold a whopping 35 million shares, reducing BRK.B's stake by more than 40%. However, that move was simply made to avoid regulatory headaches. Indeed, the purchaser of the shares was none other than PSX.

As Buffett said at the time: ""Phillips 66 is a great company with a diversified downstream portfolio and a strong management team. This transaction was solely motivated by our desire to eliminate the regulatory requirements that come with ownership levels above 10%.""

The thing is, Buffett continues to burn off Berkshire Hathaway's PSX holdings. Even after the big sale back to PSX in the Q1 2018, BRK.B remained the company's largest shareholder with 9.8% of all shares outstanding. But Buffett kept selling. In the first quarter of 2019 alone, he pared Berkshire's stake by another 53%. Berkshire now owns just 1.2% of Phillips 66's shares outstanding. Buffett has been characteristically mum on his reasons for the sales.

Torchmark/Globe Life

Shares held: 6,353,727

Holding value: $568,405,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.27%

Torchmark is a small holding for Berkshire Hathaway but a natural one. After all, it's a life and health insurance company, and various wholly owned insurance firms form the core of BRK.B's holdings.

Berkshire Hathaway has owned shares in Torchmark since early 2001, and while it's a boring company, it has quietly been a very good stock pick. Including dividends, TMK has generated an annualized return of 10.5% since March 30, 2001.

Just note that this longtime holding just got a little bit of a facelift. Effective Aug. 8, it is now called Globe Life (GL, $85.81), which should be reflected in Berkshire's third-quarter 13F.

BRK.B owns 5.8% of Torchmark's (now Globelife's) shares outstanding, which makes it the firm's third-largest shareholder after Vanguard and BlackRock (BLK).

Restaurant Brands International

Shares held: 8,438,225

Holding value: $586,794,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.28%

Investors may be forgiven if they're unfamiliar with Restaurant Brands International (QSR, $73.58). After all, it's a pretty bland name.

But there's no doubt they know the Canadian company's fast-food chains.

QSR was formed by the 2014 merger of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Three years later, the company acquired Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, making it the world's fifth-largest operator of fast food restaurants.

So where does Warren Buffett come in? Berkshire Hathaway helped fund Burger King's acquisition of Tim Hortons by purchasing a combination of preferred shares and warrants. In a classic Buffett move, he was able to finagle a 9% yield from the preferred shares. QSR redeemed the preferreds in 2017, adding to Berkshire's cash pile.

BRK.B still owns 3.3% of the fast-food company's shares outstanding, making it QSR's eighth-largest investor.

Store Capital

Shares held: 18,621,674

Holding value: $618,053,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.30%

It was notable when Buffett revealed Berkshire's position in Store Capital (STOR, $36.22) in the summer of 2017. Prior to Store, real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way to invest in real estate without owning the actual assets - were never big among Buffett stocks.

In Store's case, it invests in single-tenant properties including chain restaurants, supermarkets, drugstores and other retail, service and distribution facilities. That's to say, Store is a bet on brick-and-mortar retail, which is thought to be in permanent decline.

Buffett, however, spied value - and he spied it for quite some time. Store Capital CEO Christopher Volk told CNBC that Buffett studied the REIT for three years before taking the plunge.

Berkshire Hathaway owns 18.6 million shares, which yielded 3.6% as of Aug. 15. With a stake of 8.2%, it is Store Capital's second-largest shareholder after Vanguard.

Shares held: 20,803,000

Holding value: $721,240,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.35%

Synchrony Financial (SYF, $32.76) jibes with Buffett's affection for credit-card companies and banks. Synchrony, a major issuer of charge cards for retailers, was spun off of GE Capital in 2014. It's both a lender and a payments processor - like Buffett's beloved American Express (AXP) - but it caters to customers who skew more toward the middle and lower end of the income scale.

Berkshire initiated a position in SYF during the second quarter of 2017, paying an estimated price per share of $30.02. Since the end of Q2 2017, the stock has delivered a total return of 15.7%.

BRK.B owns 3% of Synchrony Financial's shares outstanding, which makes it the firm's seventh-largest shareholder.

Axalta Coating Systems

Shares held: 24,264,000

Holding value: $722,339,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.35%

Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA, $27.52), which makes industrial coatings and paints for building facades, pipelines and cars, is the belle of the ball when it comes to mergers and acquisitions suitors. The company has rejected more than one buyout bid in the past, and analysts note that it's a perfect target for numerous global coatings companies.

Berkshire Hathaway got involved in 2015, when it purchased 20 million shares in AXTA from private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG). The stake makes sense given that Buffett is a long-time fan of the paint industry; Berkshire Hathaway bought house-paint maker Benjamin Moore in 2000.

Berkshire is Axalta's largest investor, holding 10.3% of the shares outstanding.

Liberty Global

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 19,791,000 / 7,346,968

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $534,159,000 / $194,915,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.35%

As noted above with Liberty Latin America, Liberty Global Class A (LBTYA, $26.03) and Liberty Global Class C (LBTYK, $25.73) are part of a spectrum of Berkshire Hathaway holdings in communications and media companies whipped up by billionaire dealmaker John Malone.

Liberty Global bills itself as the world's largest international TV and broadband company, with operations in 10 European countries. Berkshire's investment in the Class A shares dates to the fourth quarter of 2013. It picked up the Class C shares, which have no voting power, in the first quarter of 2014.

Between the Class A and Class C shares, Berkshire Hathaway owns a 3.7% stake in Liberty Global, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. And the holding company is Liberty's fifth-largest shareholder.

Shares held: 137,915,729

Holding value: $769,570,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.37%

Sirius XM (SIRI, $5.97) - a company that reaches more than 100 million listeners via its core satellite radio business and Pandora, which it acquired in 2018 - is another stock pick related to John Malone. Malone is chairman of Liberty Media, which owns a massive stake in Sirius XM.

As Kiplinger has noted, it's possible that all of Berkshire's investments in companies that are somehow tied to Malone's truly Byzantine corporate structure could very well be the responsibility of one of Buffett's portfolio managers. Liberty Media was a large position held by Ted Weschler's Peninsula Capital in his pre-Berkshire days.

Berkshire first bought shares in SIRI during the final quarter of 2016. Berkshire's 3.1% stake in the company makes it Sirius XM's second-largest shareholder after Liberty Media, which owns almost 69% of the shares outstanding.

Travelers

Shares held: 5,958,391

Holding value: $890,899,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.43%

Few Buffett stocks are such natural fits as Travelers (TRV, $145.59), the blue-chip insurance giant. Insurance, after all, is the holding company's core business. In addition to TRV, Berkshire Hathaway has a stake in insurer Torchmark/Globe Life and counts numerous insurer companies as wholly owned subsidiaries. Geico, General Re and United States Liability Insurance Group are just three companies BRK.B owns as part of its sprawling insurance empire.

And Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a modest dividend yield of 2.3%, has the kind of pedigree and income stream Buffett favors.

Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in Travelers in the third quarter of 2018, then boosted its stake by 68% in the fourth quarter. BRK.B now holds almost 6 million shares in TRV.

At less than $1 billion, the stake is relatively small beer for Berkshire Hathaway, but it's a big deal to Travelers. Buffett's holding company is Travelers' seventh-largest shareholder, owning 2.3% of all shares outstanding.

M&T Bank

Shares held: 5,382,040

Holding value: $915,324,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.44%

As we shall see, Warren Buffett has been initiating positions in several bank stocks over the past few quarters, but he's been a fan of M&T Bank (MTB, $144.67) for a very long time. Indeed, MTB has been a member in good standing of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio since 2001.

The regional bank operates more than 750 branches in eight states, including New York, Maryland and New Jersey, as well as Washington, D.C., and it has been profitable year after year for decades. It also has been a reliable dividend payer. Buffett has a soft spot for well-run, unassuming businesses. And he frequently cites the importance of management talent when it comes to deciding where to invest. He certainly was a fan of M&T Bank's late CEO.

In 2011, Buffett recommended that Berkshire Hathaway shareholders read M&T's annual reports, which were written by Robert Williams, chairman and CEO from 1983 until his death in 2017. ""Bob is a very smart guy and he has a lot of good observations,"" Buffett said.

Although M&T Bank represents a small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio, BRK.B is a big holder of MTB. With 3.9% of shares outstanding, Berkshire is the bank's seventh-largest shareholder.

Red Hat

Shares held: 5,171,890

Holding value: $971,074,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.47%

In another investment most likely made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, Berkshire Hathaway first took a stake in Red Hat in the fourth quarter of 2018. Buffett himself tends to shy away from technology stocks such as Red Hat, which is an open-source software company, and the comparatively small stake of less than $1 billion is another clue.

What's really intriguing about the position in Red Hat is that the company agreed to be acquired by International Business Machines (IBM) for $34 billion in October 2018. Despite this, Buffett entered his position in Q4 2018, then bought more in each of 2019's first two quarters. The deal - intended to boost Big Blue's cloud-based services business - closed in early July, so Red Hat's shares no longer trade on the public markets. Thus, Red Hat won't show up in Berkshire's portfolio as of the third-quarter filing.

Ironically, IBM is one of Warren Buffett's most high-profile bad bets. The usually tech-shy investor surprised Wall Street when Berkshire Hathaway revealed in 2011 that it scooped up nearly $11 billion worth of Big Blue. Buffett added to the stake in the ensuing years before souring on IBM in 2017. Berkshire eventually sold its entire position.

Amazon.com

Shares held: 537,300

Holding value: $1,017,447,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.49%

Amazon.com (AMZN, $1,776.12) is Berkshire Hathaway's splashiest new stock pick. The holding company disclosed it initiated a position of 483,300 shares in the first quarter of 2019, then added another 54,000 shares in Q2.

It wasn't Buffett's idea, though.

The clue? Before Berkshire Hathaway submitted its first-quarter regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett told CNBC: ""One of the fellows in the office that manage money ... bought some Amazon, so it will show up (when that file is submitted).""

Buffett has long been an admirer of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, he admitted in an interview, and said he wished he'd bought the stock sooner.

""Yeah, I've been a fan, and I've been an idiot for not buying"" AMZN shares, Buffett told CNBC. Berkshire still is an insignificant shareholder, however, boasting about 0.1% of Amazon's shares outstanding.

Costco

Shares held: 4,333,363

Holding value: $1,145,135,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.55%

Costco (COST, $271.52) joined the ranks of the Buffett stocks a long time back - the first quarter of 2001, to be precise. So while Costco is not a particularly large holding, at just more than half a percent of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, it's a seemingly cherished one.

And it's a company Buffett is happy to chat about at length.

""Here (Kraft Heinz) are, 100 years plus, tons of advertising, built into people's habits and everything else,"" Buffett told CNBC in a February 2019 interview. ""And now, Kirkland, a private label brand, comes along and with only 250 or so outlets, does 50% more business than all the Kraft Heinz brands.""

Indeed, Costco's Kirkland store-branded products are one of the warehouse retailer's biggest draws. Revenues from the Kirkland label totaled $39 billion last year - more than 27% of Costco's overall annual sales, and about 50% greater than Kraft Heinz's total sales across 2018.

Berkshire's 4.3 million shares represent a roughly 1% equity stake in the company - not unsubstantial, but well outside Costco's top 10 institutional stakes.

PNC Financial Services

Shares held: 8,671,054

Holding value: $1,190,362,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.57%

PNC Financial Services (PNC, $124.74), the nation's sixth-largest bank by assets and second-largest regional lender, is part of a big recent bet by Buffett on the financial sector.

Buffett first started investing in PNC in the third quarter of 2018. He upped Berkshire Hathaway's stake by another 4% in Q1 2019. The holding company is now PNC's 10th-largest investor with 1.9% of the bank's shares outstanding.

Buffett has long been comfortable with investing in the banking business. At the 1995 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, he said the industry ""falls within our circle of competence to evaluate."" Given Berkshire's big push into banks over the past few quarters - BRK.B has added to or started new positions in more than a half-dozen financial stocks recently - Buffett clearly sees a lot of value in this corner of the market.

Mastercard

Shares held: 4,934,756

Holding value: $1,305,391,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.63%

Warren Buffett credits Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Mastercard (MA, $271.89) to his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and he wishes he had pulled the trigger on the opportunity earlier.

""I could have bought them as well, and looking back, I should have,"" Buffett said about Visa (V) and Mastercard in 2018, referring to his own investment in American Express.

As noted above with StoneCo, Buffett is a big believer in companies that process payments.

Berkshire Hathaway initiated its position in Mastercard during the first quarter of 2011, and given the stock's performance ever since, it's obvious why Buffett wishes Berkshire Hathaway owned more. Including dividends, MA shares have generated an annualized return of 34.8% since March 31, 2011.

American Airlines

Getty Images





Shares held: 43,700,000

Holding value: $1,425,057,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.68%

Warren Buffett isn't afraid to change his mind, and perhaps his most surprising volte-face came in regard to the airline industry. Buffett long excoriated the sector, calling it a ""death trap"" for investors.

""If a capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk back in the early 1900s he should've shot Orville Wright; he would have saved his progeny money,"" Buffett once wrote.

But airline stocks became Buffett stocks in 2016. That's when he started picking up stakes in four major carriers, including American Airlines (AAL, $25.41). Years of industry consolidation and Buffett's confidence in the U.S. economy's long-term dynamism finally made the time ripe for Berkshire Hathaway to buy.

""It's true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They're like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope,"" he told CNBC.

Berkshire Hathaway initiated a stake in AAL in the third quarter of 2016. Buffett has been an incremental seller ever since to remain below a 10% ownership threshold that would trigger regulatory headaches. Berkshire Hathaway is American's second-largest shareholder with 9.7% of the firm's shares outstanding.

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 14,860,360 / 31,090,985

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $561,871,000 / $1,180,836,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.84%

Sirius XM is the company so nice, Buffett needs to own it twice. Well, thrice. Sort of.

When dealing with John Malone's companies, it gets complicated.

Liberty Media has for years held a large stake in Sirius XM Holdings. But in 2015, the company actually recapitalized, offering (among other things) several tracking stocks that allowed investors to enjoy in the performance of Liberty's Sirius XM investment directly rather than get it piecemeal through Liberty Media itself.

Thus, Buffett was exposed to Sirius XM before it directly invested in SIRI shares in Q4 2016. But over time, he has bought more of the tracking stock, which currently represents a 70.4% stake in Sirius XM. The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio now holds roughly 46 million shares of Liberty Sirius XM Group Series A (LSXMA, $39.50) and Liberty Sirius XM Group Series C (LSXMK, $40.05) combined.

In fact, Warren Buffett is the largest institutional shareholder in each class, holding 4.6% of Liberty Sirius XM's A shares, and 14.7% of the C shares. Combined with his SIRI stake, the Oracle of Omaha holds three different investments in Sirius XM.

Visa

Shares held: 10,562,460

Holding value: $1,833,115,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.88%

Like Mastercard, Visa (V, $176.27) was the idea of lieutenants Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler (Buffett won't tell). And as with Mastercard, Buffett wishes BRK.B had bought more. Visa operates the world's largest payments network, and thus is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of cashless transactions and digital mobile payments.

Berkshire Hathaway first bought Visa in the third quarter of 2011, and it has proven to be a winner of a stock pick. Including dividends, Visa has delivered a whopping annualized return of almost 33% since Sept. 30, 2011.

""If I had been as smart as Ted or Todd, I would have (bought Visa),"" Buffett told shareholders at the 2018 annual meeting.

Berkshire owns 0.5% of Visa's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

United Continental

Shares held: 21,938,642

Holding value: $1,920,728,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.92%

United Continental (UAL, $81.62) is one of the four major airline stocks that Buffett bought during the third quarter of 2016 when he surprised the market with his about-face on the industry.

Less than a year later, it represented something of a black eye when a passenger was injured while being removed against his will from a sold-out flight. But United has recovered from that reputational hit, in part simply because there are so few options that boast its geographical reach.

As noted above with American Airlines, Buffett thinks air carriers today offer much better growth prospects than they did in the last century, which was a bloodbath for capital.

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio holds 8.2% of UAL shares outstanding, making it the airline's second-largest shareholder. United's stock has delivered an annualized total return of about 19% since the end of Q3 2016.

Charter Communications

Shares held: 5,426,609

Holding value: $2,144,487,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.03%

Charter Communications (CHTR, $380.94) is yet another Berkshire Hathaway portfolio holding with a John Malone connection - albeit a small one now. Malone served on the telecom and media company's board of directors from 2013 until 2018, when he stepped down to concentrate his focus on a smaller group of companies. (He does remain a director emeritus, however.)

Charter Communications markets cable TV, internet, telephone and other services under the Spectrum brand, which is America's second-largest cable operator behind Comcast (CMCSA). It greatly expanded its reach in 2016 when it acquired Time Warner Cable and sister company Bright House Networks.

Buffett entered CHTR in the second quarter of 2014, but he has seemingly lost his love for the telecom company in recent years. His position has been trimmed down from 9.4 million shares in early 2017 to just 5.4 million shares as of Berkshire's most recent 13F. The move away from Charter meshed with a lousy 2018 for the stock, which lost 15% that year, though Buffett dropped another fifth of his position in Q1 2019 - during which CHTR roared ahead by nearly 22%. Berkshire shed another 284,102 in the second quarter.

The current stake represents about 1% of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, and a decent-sized 2.4% ownership in Charter.

Shares held: 38,565,570

Holding value: $2,169,698,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.04%

Berkshire disclosed a position in DaVita (DVA, $58.36) in the first quarter of 2012.

Since DVA was a large position of Ted Weschler's Peninsula Capital in his pre-Berkshire days, it wasn't unreasonable to assume that it was his pick. Weschler confirmed as much in 2014.

DaVita, which provides kidney care and operates dialysis centers, serves more than 1.7 million patients in the U.S. and nine other countries. Aging baby boomers and a graying population in many developed markets should provide a strong, secular tailwind.

Berkshire, by the way, is DaVita's largest shareholder by a wide margin. Its stake of 38.6 million shares accounts for 23% of DVA's shares outstanding.

Verisign

Shares held: 12,952,745

Holding value: $2,709,196,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.30%

Stocks aren't good or bad in a bubble - one investor's brilliant purchase often is, depending on timing, another investor's biggest failure.

Take Verisign (VRSN, $203.40) - an internet infrastructure service company that quite literally keeps the world connected online and acts as a domain registry for the .com, .net and other top-level domains.

Stanley Druckenmiller, a famed former hedge fund manager, made a $200 million short on tech stocks in early 1999 while investing for George Soros' Quantum Fund, but lost $600 million in the trade. He then tried to win it back via a big $6 billion buy-in of tech stocks including Verisign ... but he lost $3 billion in six weeks as VRSN and several other recent purchases flopped, making it one of the ""smart money's"" worst stock calls of all time.

The Oracle of Omaha has had an entirely different experience.

Berkshire bought Verisign, whose dominance of the space exemplifies Buffett's love of deep moats, during a dip in the final quarter of 2012. The roughly 3.7 million shares were purchased at an average cost of $38.82 per share. VRSN has returned more than 420% since the end of 2012 - well more than triple the S&P 500's roughly 127% return including dividends.

Berkshire Hathaway now owns almost 13 million shares in the company, making it the largest institutional investor in Verisign at a 10.8% ownership stake.

Shares held: 53,649,213

Holding value: $2,724,307,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.31%

Southwest Airlines (LUV, $48.21) is part of the quartet of major airline stocks Buffett bought in late 2016. The discount carrier is beloved by its customers and employees alike, typically finding itself near the top of ""Best Airline"" and ""Best Places to Work For"" lists.

As an investment, it has performed decently within the Berkshire fold. LUV has generated an annualized total return of 14.3% since Aug. 31, 2016.

Berkshire Hathaway pared its position in LUV by 2%, or 1.2 million shares in the first quarter of 2019, but that doesn't mean Buffett is suddenly bearish. The selling was necessary to keep Berkshire's ownership stake below 10%, which would trigger regulatory hassles.

BRK.B remains Southwest Airlines second-largest shareholder, holding 9.9% of the company's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

General Motors

Shares held: 72,269,696

Holding value: $2,784,551,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.34%

Warren Buffett first took a stake in General Motors (GM, $36.47), the world's fourth-largest auto manufacturer by production, in early 2012. He most recently upped Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he increased his position by 37%.

With more than 72 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway is General Motors' fourth-largest investor, holding more than 5% of the car company's shares outstanding.

In many ways, GM looks like a classic Buffett value bet.

General Motors is an iconic American brand and, as the No. 1 domestic automaker, a bet on the long-term growth of the U.S. economy. Buffett has sung the praises of GM CEO Mary Barra several times, at one point saying, ""Mary is as strong as they come. She is as good as I've seen.""

GM also looks like a value pick. The stock trades at just 5.7 times expected earnings, according to data from Refinitiv, and sports a dividend yield of 4.2%. Buffett paid an estimated average price per share of $31.82 when he initiated his position in the first quarter of 2012. Including dividends, General Motors has returned 78% since March 30, 2012.

Bank of New York Mellon

Holding value: $3,573,379,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.72%

Despite its impressive-sounding moniker, Bank of New York Mellon (BK, $41.67) is not exactly a household name. But it's a big deal in financial services, and Warren Buffett has been a fan for some time.

Bank of New York Mellon is a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides back-end accounting services. Its roots actually go all the way back to 1784, when Bank of New York was founded by a group including Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Today, BK is the nation's ninth-largest bank by assets, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in BK back in the third quarter of 2010, when it paid an estimated average price of $43.90. Warren Buffett last added to Berkshire's stake in BK in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he increased his holding company's investment by 3%, or more than 3 million shares. With a total of 80.9 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway owns 8.5% of all shares outstanding, making it BK's largest investor by a decent margin. (Vanguard is No. 2 at 6.8%.)

Goldman Sachs

Shares held: 18,353,635

Holding value: $3,755,154,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.80%

Just because Buffett soured on Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Verizon, don't think he's lost his love of Dow stocks.

Berkshire Hathaway first picked up its stake in Goldman Sachs (GS, $196.18) during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares came with a dividend yield of 10% - almost twice the rate of some preferred stocks, which already are considered generous income plays.

Goldman redeemed its preferred shares in 2011. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in GS stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013.

Buffett has parlayed the original investment into a 5% stake in Wall Street's preeminent investment bank, worth more than $3.7 billion. Berkshire is now the bank's fourth-largest shareholder.

Percent of portfolio: 1.93%

For an industry he once shunned, Buffett sure does like his airline stocks now.

And from the looks of things, Delta Air Lines (DAL, $57.11), which was part of the group of air carriers he first picked up in the third quarter of 2016, might be his favorite.

Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in DAL by 8%, or 5.4 million shares, during the first quarter of 2019. Indeed, the holding company is now Delta's largest shareholder, owning 10.4% of the carrier's shares outstanding. Buffett explained to CNBC that Berkshire crossed the 10% threshold because Delta bought back so much of its own stock.

Once he found out he had ""lost his virginity,"" Buffett said, he decided to buy more DAL shares anyway.

Moody's

Shares held: 24,669,778

Holding value: $4,818,254,000

Percent of portfolio: 2.32%

Moody's (MCO, $209.95) is a business and financial services firm that's best known for its Moody's Investors Service credit rating arm - one of the three major American business credit ratings agencies alongside Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. It also offers financial analysis technology via Moody's Analytics.

MCO is a longtime, significant holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio - and an ironic one to boot.

""Uncle Warren"" first dipped his toe in during the first quarter of 2001, and he has been content with his investment of late, leaving his 24.7 million-share stake unchanged over the past couple of years.

The funny thing about Berkshire's holding in Moody's is that Buffett said back in 2010 that ""Our job is to rate credit ourselves. We do not outsource that to ratings agencies."" Yet Berkshire Hathaway is the largest institutional holder of MCO, owning 13.1% of the financial firm. (Vanguard is a distant second at 7.9%.)

The holding is meaningful on Buffett's end, too. At more than 2%, Moody's is one of Berkshire's 10 largest positions.

JPMorgan Chase

Shares held: 59,514,932

Holding value: $6,653,769,000

Percent of portfolio: 3.20%

Warren Buffett has been going all in on big banks over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway initiated a position in JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $105.20), the nation's largest bank by assets, in the third quarter of 2018 and has been boosting it ever since. BRK.B's upped its stake by 40% in the fourth quarter of last year and again by 18% in the first quarter of 2019.

As noted, Buffett added to or started new positions in several American mega-banks and investment firms over the past couple of quarters.

Part of the attraction for JPMorgan is due to Warren Buffett's professed admiration for CEO Jamie Dimon. The two have partnered with Jeff Bezos, chairman and CEO of Amazon.com, to form a health care initiative intended to improve coverage and lower costs. Dimon and Buffett also have teamed up to decry the practice of giving quarterly profit forecasts, saying ""short-termism is hurting the economy.""

U.S. Bancorp

Shares held: 132,459,618

Holding value: $6,940,884,000

Percent of portfolio: 3.34%

U.S. Bancorp (USB, $51.28) is one of the oldest Buffett stocks in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The Oracle initiated his position in the first quarter of 2006.

Buffett is notoriously tight-lipped about U.S. Bancorp, Barron's notes, but the nation's fifth-largest bank by assets and America's biggest regional bank has been a solid stock pick. The lender has consistently generated the highest returns among the top 10 banks.

Warren Buffett just boosted Berkshire Hathaway's stake in USB during the second quarter, with a small addition of about 132 million shares. The position now accounts for 3.3% of the holding company's equity portfolio. BRK.B is the company's largest shareholder, owning 8.3% of its shares outstanding. Vanguard, a large shareholder in many blue chips, is No. 2 with a 7.2% stake.

Shares in the bank have delivered an annualized total return of 7% since March 31, 2006.

Kraft Heinz

Shares held: 325,634,818

Percent of portfolio: 4.86%

Warren Buffett was one of the driving forces behind the 2015 merger of packaged-food giant Kraft and ketchup purveyor Heinz to create Kraft Heinz (KHC, $25.06). It's Berkshire's sixth-largest stock investment with a current market value of $10.1 billion.

And Buffett regrets it.

Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $3 billion non-cash loss from an impairment of intangible assets in 2018, ""arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz,"" Buffett wrote in his 2019 letter to shareholders.

More succinctly, in an interview with CNBC, Buffett said ""I was wrong"" on KHC. Yup, he says he overpaid. Kraft's shares have lost 18.5% on an annualized total return basis since Sept. 30, 2015.

Berkshire Hathaway owns 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, making it the food company's second-largest shareholder, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Private investment firm 3G Capital - who teamed up with Berkshire in 2013 to purchase H.J. Heinz - is tops at 48.8%.

American Express

Shares held: 151,610,700

Holding value: $18,714,825,000

Percent of portfolio: 8.99%

Buffett likes to say this his preferred holding period is ""forever."" Look no further than Dow component American Express (AXP, $122.38) to understand just how serious he is about investing for the long haul.

Buffett picked up his initial stake in the credit card company in 1963, when a struggling AmEx badly needed capital. Berkshire obliged, getting favorable terms on its investment. Buffett has played the role of white knight many times over the years, including during the 2008 financial crisis, as a means to get stakes in good companies at a discount. (Think: Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.)

Berkshire Hathaway, which owns 18% of American Express' shares outstanding, is by far the company's largest shareholder. No. 2 Vanguard owns less than 6%. Buffett praised the power of AmEx's brand at Berkshire's 2019 annual meeting. ""It's a fantastic story, and I'm glad we own 18% of it,"" he said.

Wells Fargo

Shares held: 409,803,773

Holding value: $19,391,913,000

Percent of portfolio: 9.79%

Wells Fargo (WFC, $43.38) has been roiled by a series of scandals since 2016, including opening millions of phony accounts, modifying mortgages without authorization and charging customers for auto insurance they did not need.

It's been a slow clean-up process. The bank in early June reached a $386 million deal to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by customers who say WFC forced them to buy unnecessary car insurance.

But Buffett appears to stand by the nation's fourth-largest bank by assets. ""If you look at Wells, through this whole thing they're uncovering a whole lot of problems, but they aren't losing any customers to speak of,"" Buffett told Financial Times in an April interview. Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares in WFC in 2001. Although Buffett pared the stake by 3%, or 17 million shares, in the first quarter of 2019, Wells Fargo still is an outsize holding in Berkshire's portfolio.

And Berkshire remains WFC's largest shareholder with 8.4% of all shares outstanding.

Buffett, an unabashed fan of Cherry Coke, started investing in Coca-Cola (KO, $53.87) soon after the stock market crash of 1987. In his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he expected to hold on to the stock ""for a long time.""

Three decades later, he has proven true to his word. Berkshire is KO's largest shareholder with 9.4% of its shares outstanding.

Coca-Cola made a brief appearance as a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 1930s. Shares were added back to the Dow in 1987, and they've remained a stalwart member ever since.

While Coca-Cola's stock performance hasn't impressed - its 55% total returns over the past five years come up about six percentage points shy of the S&P 500 - it has been an income investor's dream. The beverage maker has increased its dividend annually for 57 years.

Shares held: 927,248,600

Holding value: $26,890,210,000

Percent of portfolio: 12.92%

It should be clear by now that Buffett is bonkers for bank stocks. And the crown jewel of his financial sector holdings is Bank of America (BAC, $26.25), the nation's second-largest bank by assets.

Buffett's interest in BAC dates back to 2011, when he swooped in to shore up the firm's finances in the wake of the Great Recession. In exchange for investing $5 billion in the firm, Berkshire received preferred stock yielding 6% and warrants giving Berkshire the right to purchase BofA common stock at a steep discount. (The Oracle of Omaha exercised those warrants in 2017, netting a $12 billion profit in the process.)

Warren Buffett recently tacked on to his position, adding roughly 927 million shares during the second quarter of 2019. That's an upgrade of about 3% for Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire now holds 927.2 million shares, worth $26.9 billion.

BofA is a big deal for Berkshire Hathaway, and it works the other way around, too. BAC shares account for a whopping 12.9% of Buffett's equity portfolio. By the same token, Berkshire is Bank of America's largest shareholder, at 9.1% of its shares outstanding.

Shares held: 249,589,329

Holding value: $49,398,720,000

Percent of portfolio: 23.74%

Apple (AAPL, $201.74) is king of the Buffett stocks. The Oracle of Omaha has never been much of a tech investor, but he sure does love Apple. He took his first bite in early 2016, and the iPhone maker has since become Berkshire Hathaway's single-largest holding. Brace yourselves: AAPL accounts for nearly a quarter of the total value of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.

And at almost 250 million shares, BRK.B is Apple's third-largest investor. The holding company owns 5.1% of all AAPL shares outstanding. Only Vanguard and BlackRock - giants of the passively managed index fund universe - hold more Apple stock.

Unlike many of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, Buffett has been happy to discuss his ardor for Apple. As he has said more than once on CNBC, he loves the power of Apple's brand and its ecosystem of products (such as the iPhone and iPad) and services (such as Apple Pay and iTunes).

""I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year,"" Buffett has said. ""I focus on the ... hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who practically live their lives by (the iPhone).""

60,Highly rated U.S. companies are borrowing $1 trillion at a record clip,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCCXUcteYzUA6gzQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByNDZ0aWFxBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM2BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411799/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.marketwatch.com%2fstory%2fhighly-rated-us-companies-are-borrowing-1-trillion-at-a-record-clip-2020-05-21%3fsiteid%3dyhoof2%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=RbFZlClBVYl8bIhAh31_Ltg51Kw-,2020-05-21 00:00:00,"The coronavirus pandemic has spurred U.S. companies with investment-grade credit ratings to borrow at the fastest pace in history to start a year, with new bond issuance topping $1 trillion in less than five months, supported by Federal Reserve programs to buy corporate bonds.

That is the quickest clip ever for new investment-grade corporate bond supply to kick off a year, according to BofA Global analysts, who pointed out that the $1 trillion threshold was eclipsed on Tuesday.

The borrowing spree is notable not only because it’s about double the pace seen last year over the same period, per BofA data, but also for how easily its been for companies to borrow cheaply, while paying investors so little to bankroll their operations in an uncertain environment.

“Concessions are near to nothing at this point,” said Wendy Wyatt, portfolio manager, DuPont Capital Management, referring to the slight discount in price investors typically get when buying newly minted bonds, versus similar, existing bonds in the market.

She said the old “bait and switch,” common during bull markets, is alive and well. “They offer a nice, attractive spread to get people interested and then walk it in aggressively,” she told MarketWatch. While bankers are hired to cut the best possible deal for their corporate clients, the process also ends up handing investors bonds that pay substantially less than expected.

As an example, AutoNation Inc. AN, -0.32% a national chain of car dealerships, with credit ratings one step above speculative-grade (or junk-bond) territory at Baa3/BBB-, borrowed $500 million in the bond market Tuesday, just as issuance hit $1 trillion. The company ended up paying a yield of 4.8%, after pricing narrowed by as much as 77 basis points from initial guidance circulated by bankers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the dealings.

AutoNation was one of several public companies that gave back funding from the U.S. Treasury Department’s hallmark $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which aims to help small businesses stay float during the pandemic by covering payroll. The Treasury warned earlier in May that the program was not meant for “a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets.”

Like many of its peers, AutoNation swung to a net loss of $232.3 million in the first-quarter, or $2.58 a share, from net income of $92.0 million, or $1.01 a share, in the year-ago period, as car sales plunged during nationwide shutdowns. Although it reported a slight pickup in late April as more states reopened.

A spokesperson said AutoNation was pleased by investor interest in its new bond deal, which saw strong demand.

This CreditSights chart shows how revenue growth already was slumping at highly rated U.S. companies even before the coronavirus left many industries with flat, or negative growth, in the first quarter.

Median revenue growth barely positive CreditSights

Being a part of the trillion-dollar club, whether by market capitalization like tech-giants Microsoft Corp., MSFT, +0.04% or Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.64% , or in terms of world economies, used to a big thing.

But it’s become less stunning as the U.S. corporate bond world has mushroomed over the past decade, reaching $9.6 trillion on issue and rivaling the $10.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities market at the end of last year.

And it’s gotten even harder lately to square what $1 trillion really means, particularly as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet nears $7 trillion and Congress is urging it to unleash the more than $2 trillion in emergency funds approved to help bridge businesses, states, cities and households through coronavirus shutdowns.

This year’s dizzying pace of corporate borrowing comes as U.S. stocks have shrugged off the worst of the coronavirus selloff in March, with investors feeling bullish about the path of the U.S. economic recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.03% headed lower Thursday, but in the prior session ended only about 17% below its February all-time closing record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

What could go wrong? While a lot of attention has been paid to new borrowing activity, there also has been a blistering pace of credit-ratings firm downgrades hitting U.S. investment-grade companies, with BofA tracking more than $1 trillion since the end of February.

This chart shows the speed of downgrades, in days, so far in this cycle when compared with prior crises.

Flood of downgrades BofA Global

Wyatt warned that credit ratings painted too rosy a picture of U.S. corporations, particularly since many companies were “over leveraged going into the crisis,” and now face a revenue hit from weeks of lockdowns designed to tamp down the coronavirus.

“I’d say the credit-rating firms were too slow to act in the past two years, based on pure fundamental metrics,” Wyatt said.

“Now they have to borrow a year’s worth of cash to burn, to keep the company moving forward, but their ability to continue to pay that indebtedness has decreased.”

In it, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.04% Chief Executive Satya Nadella laid out his vision for “empowering every developer.” His 20-minute speech was followed by a series of live and prerecorded tutorials on coding, cloud computing, and other geeky topics from TV-like studios on the Microsoft campus, buttressed by slick graphics and pretaped videos, all day and night. And all of it was free, with easy access to 509 sessions and documentation. The two-day conference had the look and feel of content-on-demand a la Netflix Inc. NFLX, -1.58%

A week earlier, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.86% Chief Executive Jensen Huang delivered a two-hour keynote at GTC Digital in nine 12-minute slices, based on topics ranging from autonomous vehicles to artificial intelligence. The presentation, taped in Huang’s kitchen, attracted 4 million views. This year, 57,000 developers signed up to attend; last year, 10,000 physically attended the conference in San Jose, Calif.

Such is the new world of tech conferences in the age of COVID-19. They’ve gone all-digital, like Build and GTC Digital, and may never be the same. Absent a vaccine, the days of thousands of people herded into hotel ballrooms and convention centers like cattle, sharing cabs and eating in cramped quarters, are gone.

Far from crippling the tech industry, however, virtual shows could lead to democratization of what had once been an exclusive, pricey privilege for tech movers and shakers. In the new climate, consumers have free access to valuable technical content whenever they wish to view it.

“This will definitely change the approach of tech conferences. Virtually, you can identify attendees online and track what they see,” Paddy Cosgrave, chief executive of the company that runs the Web Summit and Collision conferences, told MarketWatch in a phone interview Monday. The show, originally planned June 22-25 in Toronto, will go on as an all-digital event those days.

“If the show is pure content and not networking, like an F8 or Build, you can upsell to them virtually,” he said. “F8, AWS, and Build are like infomercials, selling to an existing customer base.”

“Without question it was a better experience: free, no red-eye flight, no hotel room charges, and better access to the Microsoft team,” Laron Walker, CEO of Mantisedu Inc., an Atlanta-based education hardware partner of Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. “Last year, I paid several thousand dollars to attend, and if I was late for a session, I couldn’t rewind it. This year, I could.”

Walker, 41, said he was able to view sessions at any time, pause them to take notes, and then pass them on to co-workers. He was also able to connect with Build speakers via LinkedIn and email because he had more information about them via their presentations. “This made me look at tech conferences in a whole new light,” he said.

Developers conferences are as much an annual ritual in the tech industry as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.64% product launches and gargantuan shows like CES and Mobile World Congress. All told, they set the narrative for developers and, eventually, consumers over the next year or two.

May is usually the epicenter of such gatherings. Before COVID-19, executives, analysts, business partners, and the press had scheduled their travel schedules to attend Microsoft’s Build (May 19-21, in Seattle), Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +0.46% GOOG, +0.54% I/O summit (May 12-14, Mountain View, Calif.), and Facebook Inc.’s FB, +1.52% F8 (May 5-6, in San Jose).

Two of those shows were dropped while a third will be vastly restructured. For example:

Apple: “We are delivering WWDC 2020 this June in an innovative way to millions of developers around the world, bringing the entire developer community together with a new experience,” Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement May 5. “We look forward to sharing more details about WWDC20 with everyone as we get closer to this exciting event” on June 22. The event is free for all developers.

Facebook: The company, which has vowed not to host events of more than 50 people until June 2021, is “still working through what F8 and more broadly what FB’s events/conference approach will be beyond June 2021,” a company spokesperson told MarketWatch.

Google: Google canceled I/O altogether and declined to comment on the show next year. The show will go on, however, for Google Cloud Next ‘20, with more than 200 sessions over nine weeks, from July 14 through Sept. 8, a Google Cloud spokesperson told MarketWatch.

Amazon: AWS Insights Online Conference is offering a free half-day “educational immersion” tutorial on media tech capabilities on May 28.

The evolution of developer conferences was inevitable in an era of lightning-fast streaming services, content on demand, and videoconferencing. A developer in say, Spain, can binge-watch cloud-computing solutions on one channel while another in Brazil views an archived keynote speech at roughly the same time. If it sounds suspiciously like a viewing experience on Netflix or Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, +0.16% Disney+, that is the goal, she and others say.

Microsoft was already in the process of “re-imaging” how to connect more with developers to improve engagement, accessibility, resources, and content before COVID-19 — which accelerated its plan, Charlotte Yarkoni, corporate vice president of cloud and AI at Microsoft, told MarketWatch in a phone interview.

“People don’t like watching something that requires you to sit for four hours; they prefer content when they choose to watch regardless of time zones,” said Yarkoni, who called first-day demand and interest of Build “unprecedented.” She said interest in the weeks leading up to the two-day conference signaled that Build would experience a bump. Traffic for Microsoft Learn, a learning-platform for technical content usually used by developers, was up 272% in April, year-over-year, she said. What is more, Microsoft now has more than 72 million monthly active users across its technical documentation and learning sites.

Perhaps, another tech executive suggests, the preponderance of consumers using Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM, -0.56% has conditioned them to digest technical information online.

“Business-to-business conferences like ours are dependent on people meeting in-person,” Okta Inc. OKTA, +2.53% CEO Todd McKinnon told MarketWatch in a phone interview. But his perception changed after this year’s edition of Oktane20 Live, an all-digital show in early April, drew record attendance. He’s now considering a permanent shift to a hybrid model of both in-person and digital attendees next year and beyond.

“We had tons of leads and off-the-charts engagement with an all-digital format,” McKinnon said after 20,000 attended, compared with 6,000 a year ago.

Nutanix Inc.’s NTNX, +2.49% Global .NEXT Digital Experience was to take place June 30-July 2 in Chicago. Now, it’s scheduled to be online in September.

“COVID-19 has forced Nutanix to think outside the box,” Nutanix Inc. Chief Marketing Officer Ben Gibson told MarketWatch in an email. “Consumers can expect the same great content from our traditional in-person events but on a schedule that best suits them — from the comfort of their home office.”

Before we write off the concept of the classic tech conference — even with the best of intentions and a treasure trove of content, there is no better way to network than in person, Collision’s Cosgrave points out. “Bigger conferences for meant for networking -- dinners, cocktails, late-night meetings,” he said. “The flurry of networking is the utility of conferences. Speakers and panels are an excuse to go.”

“At the end of the day, we hope to be back in person in Toronto next year,” he said."

During Wednesday's Mad Money program Jim Cramer suggested to viewers that investors may be reaching for the stock equivalent of comfort food in the way of the tried and true FAANG stocks.

Let's check out the charts of GOOGL.

In this daily bar chart of GOOGL, below, we can see how prices quickly shed about $500 per share by late March and then recovered about $400 of the decline. Prices are back above the rising 200-day moving average line and the slope of the quicker-to-react 50-day moving average line has turned positive.

The daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been moving higher from late March and is now close to breaking above its February peak. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator moved to a buy signal last month but has flattened out recently and could turn up or down from here depending on the price action ahead.

In this weekly bar chart of GOOGL, below, we see a positive picture. Prices are back above the rising 40-week moving average line.

The OBV line is pointed up telling us that buyers in this time frame are more aggressive. The MACD is crossing the zero line from below for a new buy signal.

In this Point and Figure chart of GOOGL, below, we ignore time and volume and small jiggles. Here the software is projecting an upside price target in the $1589 area.

Bottom line strategy: The broad market and GOOGL have made an impressive recovery since the middle of March but now the pace of the rally is looking a tad tired. GOOGL is still pointed up but traders may want to raise stop protection to just below $1325."

The facility will hire 1,600 people and produce up to 20,000 wafers per month with its 5nm manufacturing process.

The announcement might seem like good news for Taiwan-based TSMC and Arizona, but it also indicates the company is becoming entangled in the escalating trade war. Let's see how this deal could affect TSMC's business, and whether or not it's becoming a pawn in the messy tech war between the U.S. and China.

It's all about Huawei

TSMC is one of three chip foundries that produce the world's most advanced chips, alongside Samsung (OTC: SSNLF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Most of the world's chip orders are split between TSMC and Samsung, since Intel's foundry mainly produces in-house chips.

TSMC's top customers include AMD, NVIDIA, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Chinese tech giant Huawei. It doesn't disclose the names of its top customers, but noted that 23% and 14% of its revenue came from its largest and second-largest customers, respectively, in fiscal 2019.

Apple is widely believed to be TSMC's largest customer, while Huawei's HiSilicon subsidiary likely ranks second. Huawei's HiSilicon unit designs a wide range of chips aimed at replacing American chips from Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD.

Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce attempted to curb Huawei's progress by placing it on an ""entity list"" that barred U.S. companies from selling their technologies to blacklisted firms without a special license. However, the ban didn't affect Huawei's relationship with TSMC, which isn't an American company.

Noticing that loophole, the Commerce Department asked all non-U.S. chip manufacturers that use American chipmaking equipment, intellectual property, or design software to apply for special licenses before shipping chips to blacklisted firms. That order forced TSMC to stop taking orders from Huawei in mid-May.

Therefore, the announcement of the new Arizona plant, which came just a few days after TSMC reportedly halted Huawei's orders, seems like a consolation prize from the U.S. government.

The Arizona plant sparks fresh questions

TSMC traditionally manufactures its most advanced chips in Taiwan, while its plants in mainland China manufacture older chips. Those silos prevent Chinese companies from stealing its newest chip designs. TSMC's other American plant in Washington state -- a former joint venture which it took full control of 20 years ago -- also manufactures older chips.

TSMC's Taiwanese plants produce 7nm chips, which generated 35% of its wafer revenue last quarter. The latest Apple, AMD, and NVIDIA chips are all manufactured on this high-end node. It started producing 5nm chips in limited quantities last year, and expects the new node to generate about 10% of its wafer revenue this year as it enters mass production.

TSMC's new Arizona plant will also manufacture 5nm chips, but it won't come online until 2024, when those chips have already aged into the previous generation. TSMC has already started producing its next-gen N5 chips in limited batches.

However, TSMC's decision to produce more chips in the U.S. raises fresh questions. The Chinese government, which considers the U.S. Commerce Department's bans against Huawei to be acts of aggression, could retaliate against TSMC's plants in Shanghai and Nanjing for halting Huawei's orders.

If TSMC shifts its production of older chips to the U.S., higher labor costs will also throttle its margins. Meanwhile, the Chinese government could ramp up its investments in SMIC, its biggest domestic chipmaker. SMIC still hasn't passed the 14nm node yet, but TSMC's decision to strengthen its ties with the U.S. could be a wake-up call that lights a state-backed fire under the business -- which could spell trouble for TSMC.

Stuck between a rock and a hard place

TSMC faced plenty of political threats before. Taiwanese leaders have questioned its ties to China, and China is wary of its tech sector's dependence on a Taiwanese chipmaker.

But aligning itself with the Trump Administration, which is arguably using TSMC as a pawn against Huawei, could permanently alienate its Chinese customers, boost its operating expenses, and tilt the scales in SMIC's favor. It also exposes TSMC to additional restrictions from the U.S. government.

TSMC's move might please the Trump Administration and Taiwan's independence-leaning ruling party. However, TSMC's decision to cut off Huawei and open a U.S. plant could hurt the chipmaker over the long run."
64,"Apple-Google contact tracing tech draws interest in 23 countries, some hedge bets",https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgiKfUcte9SoAExHQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByM3V1YTVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411807/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.reuters.com%2farticle%2fus-health-coronavirus-apps-tracing-idUSKBN22W2NW/RK=2/RS=LYV1VJZJJy36FBLJEj_CXK0ACRQ-,2020-05-20 23:48:16+00:00,"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Authorities in 23 countries across five continents have sought access to contact tracing technology from Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, the companies announced on Wednesday as they released the initial version of their system.

FILE PHOTO: A Swiss soldier shows on a mobile device the contact tracking application created by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), using Bluetooth and a design called Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T), which will be launched on May 11 by the Swiss Government for easing of the lockdown caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at the Chamblon barracks, Switzerland April 30, 2020. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo

But authorities would have to stop requiring phone numbers from users under the companies’ rules, one of several restrictions that have left governments fighting the novel coronavirus frustrated that the world’s top two smartphone software makers undercut the technology’s usefulness by prioritizing user privacy.

Apple and Google said several U.S. states and 22 countries have sought access to their technology, but it is unclear how many will end up publishing mobile apps that use it.

Using apps to accelerate contact tracing, in which authorities identify and test people who were recently near a virus carrier, has emerged as a tool to stem new outbreaks. It could help authorities test more potentially infected individuals than they would normally be able to based on patients recalling recent interactions from memory.

But some governments contend their app-based efforts would be more effective if they could track users’ locations to identify hot spots for virus transmission and notify them about possible exposure through calls or texts, rather than a generic push notification.

Apple and Google have barred authorities using their technology from collecting GPS location data or requiring users to enter personal data.

“We have a collision of tech, privacy and health professionals and the Venn diagram doesn’t really have a spot where they all overlap,” said Chester Wisniewski, a principal research scientist at cybersecurity company Sophos.

Australia, the United Kingdom and other countries that have sought to develop their own technology are experiencing glitches, draining device batteries and seeing limited adoption.

Apple and Google have said their system will more reliably use Bluetooth connections between devices to log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes.

Developers of contact tracing apps for Austria, Germany and Switzerland told Reuters this week they were moving forward with the Apple-Google technology and were fine not knowing users’ phone numbers.

Other governments are hedging their bets. Norway plans to compare the effectiveness of its Smittestopp app with an Apple-Google-based app, Gun Peggy Knudsen, acting deputy director of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in an interview.

Smittestopp, which has a development budget of about $5 million, accesses GPS location and requires phone numbers. But it has seen limited use because of a low number of new infections.

Related Coverage Apple and Google still in talks with UK about COVID-19 app technology

“If the tracing is so much better with the Apple-Google tool, then perhaps we should switch and we would consider what we need to do to do the switch,” Knudsen said.

North Dakota, which offered the first U.S. contact tracing app, told Reuters on Wednesday it will leave its initial Care19 app as a location-tracking “diary” tool to help patients jog their memories. But it also will release a new Care19 Exposure app based on the Apple-Google technology.

The Australian government said it was in talks with Apple and Google about enhancing its COVIDSafe app, which currently requires phone numbers, postcodes and age ranges."

The technology provides faster wireless Internet access, with greater bandwidth and minimal delay.

As companies started transitioning to 5G technology, the U.S.-China trade war acted as a major impediment. But since the coronavirus outbreak has forced people to stay indoors, the demand for faster Internet connections has increased substantially. This is because people are spending more time now on the Internet to work, learn, shop and entertain. In fact, the pandemic helped accelerate digitization, increasing the requirement for connectivity and computing power.

In short, there has been a substantial rise in demand for infrastructure that powers the Internet worldwide. This has created an opportunity for firms dealing in server processors, graphic cards, fiber-optic connections, switches and more.

Better Infrastructure for Faster Speed

5G is considered to be way faster than 4G, with more network capacity and even better spectrum technology. This wireless technology has ample application in both consumer devices and businesses. It can benefit businesses across industrial IoT, remote health care, drones and robotics, autonomous driving, smart cities and more.

However, features like autonomous driving, IoT and advanced cloud computing cannot reach their full potential until 5G is available in every corner of the world. The widespread deployment of 5G in the coming years will have huge economic implications. In fact, 5G revolution is expected to equate to $13.2 trillion dollars of global economic output by 2035.

5G networks use mid-band as well as higher frequency airwaves, which require more equipment, cell towers and fiber-optic wiring than the previous generations. Hence, as demand for 5G grows, companies offering 5g technology infrastructure will also see a boom.

In fact, fiber-optic technology providers are major part of the 5G wireless network supply chain. Along with that, small cell radio antennas and radio access network equipment are required to link network to cloud computing infrastructure.

On the recipient side, smart phones and laptops also need to be upgraded to help users avail better and faster service. Smartphone chip maker QUALCOMM Incorporated QCOM had seen sales hitting $26.5 billion in 2014, with the release of 4G phones. The company now expects $175 million to $225 million worth of 5G handsets to be sold across the globe this year even amid the coronavirus crisis.

5 Stocks to Pick

Given the current progress in 5G rollout and coronavirus-led digitization, Internet infrastructure providers should enjoy a boom. Here are five stocks that can return well on investment.

MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc. MTSI is a developer of radio frequency (RF), microwave, and millimeter wave semiconductor devices and components. The shift to 5G would require rearranging base stations with massive multiple-in, multiple-out (or Massive MIMO) architecture. Each base station requires 5G-enabled RF antennas to provide better wireless performance without maxing out individual antenna power. Massive MIMO requires extra RF antennas that MACOM Technology manufactures, all the same, increasing its demand.

The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is more than 100% compared with the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry's projected earnings growth of 89.3%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 54.6% over the past 60 days. MACOM Technology sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

Acacia Communications, Inc. ACIA develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter is nearly 31% against the Zacks Communication - Components industry's projected earnings decline of 6.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has risen 18.7% over the past 60 days. Acacia Communications flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

Apple Inc. AAPL a leader in mobile device manufacturing is expected to roll out 5G handsets by the end of this year. However, it faces strong competition from Samsung and Huawei and there may be delay in the company's typical iPhone rollout period in September, due to the coronavirus pandemic."

Target (TGT) – Target earned 59 cents per share for the first quarter, beating the consensus estimate of 40 cents a share. Revenue beat forecasts as well. Comparable store sales rose 10.8%, beating projections of a 7.5% increase, with the bulk of the growth driven by a surge in digital sales.

Lowe's (LOW) – The home improvement retailer reported quarterly earnings of $1.77 per share, well above the $1.32 a share consensus estimate. Revenue also topped estimates, driven by an 11.2% jump in comparable-store sales. Analysts had been expecting a same-store sales increase of 3.3%. Lowe's withdrew its full-year forecast due to virus-related uncertainties.

McKesson (MCK) – The drug distributor came in 17 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly earnings of $4.27 per share. Revenue also exceeded estimates as well, however McKesson's full-year forecast came in short of analysts' consensus. The company said it anticipates headwinds stemming from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Harley-Davidson (HOG) – The company is reopening its factories this week at reduced production rates and sending dealers fewer motorcycles, according to a memo to dealers sent earlier this month and viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

United Airlines (UAL) – The airline announced a partnership with Clorox (CLX) and the Cleveland Clinic called ""United CleanPlus,"" to put guidelines and procedures in place for enhanced cleaning, safety, and social distancing.

Urban Outfitters (URBN) – Urban Outfitters lost $1.41 per share for its latest quarter, wider than the 29 cents a share loss that Wall Street was expecting. Revenue came in below forecasts as well, amid a 28% drop in comparable-store sales. The company expects a 60% decline in same-store sales for the current quarter as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to weigh on results.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) – Johnson & Johnson will stop selling its talc baby powder in the U.S. and Canada, following a significant drop in demand due to what the company calls ""misinformation"" about the product's safety. The company has been hit with thousands of lawsuits claiming the product causes cancer.

CVS Health (CVS) – CVS returned $43.3 million it had received from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. The drug store operator said it did not solicit those funds, receiving them as part of an automatic distribution by the Department of Health and Human Services. CVS said it would not participate in subsequent disbursements.

Apple (AAPL) – Apple will pay Sony (SNE) $70 million for the streaming rights to the Tom Hanks World War II film ""Greyhound,"" according to sources who spoke to CNBC. Sony had planned to debut the movie in theaters on Father's Day weekend but those plans were scuttled by the coronavirus outbreak, so it will debut instead on Apple TV.

Moderna (MRNA) – Moderna is on watch once again today, after the biotech firm's shares fell yesterday on concerns about its Monday announcement regarding a Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Some experts quoted by health website STAT say Moderna did not provide data critical to assessing whether its vaccine candidate could be successful.

Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) – Shares are being pressured by concerns over the fate of a planned $6 billion dividend payout related to Fiat Chrysler's planned merger with Peugeot parent PSA Groupe. The company has asked the Italian government for a $6.8 billion credit line. A government official told Reuters that while the dividend has not been discussed in talks, there could be some conditions set before a deal is finalized.

Red Rock Resorts (RRR) – The operator of gaming and entertainment resorts lost $2.18 per share for its latest quarter, compared to estimates of a profit of 18 cents per share. Revenue was also well below estimates, with the pandemic forcing Red Rock to close all its Las Vegas properties."

Tesla: Morgan Stanley Breaks Down The Parallels,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgiKfUcte9SoAGhHQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjR0MTVzBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM3BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411807/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.benzinga.com%2fanalyst-ratings%2fanalyst-color%2f20%2f05%2f16084937%2fapple-vs-tesla-morgan-stanley-breaks-down-the-parallels/RK=2/RS=y1T6kgVnKgB20cWjlwuUfiDxqgs-,None,"Whether Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) should be valued as a car company or tech company is still up for debate in the investment community. But recent trends have sent Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas seeking advice from his Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) colleagues.

Apple's market cap sits just south of $1.4 trillion, while Tesla's cap is around $150 billion.

Apple Vs. Tesla

“As we close in on our 10th year of covering Tesla, we find fewer of our traditional automotive/consumer/industrials clients are looking at the name,” Jonas wrote in a note.

But its tech investors are all over it.

“They view Tesla in a way they viewed Apple 20 years ago — a company that thinks differently, that is incredibly innovative in a category that needs a spurt of innovation,” Katy Huberty told Jonas.

As she describes it, tech investors care less about current valuation than about fundamentals and scale and profitability prospects. For indications of future performance, they look partly to leadership.

“There are parallels to draw between AAPL under Steve Jobs and Tesla under Elon Musk,” Huberty said. “The question for Tesla from here is whether it also needs an operational leader, as Tim Cook is to Apple, in order to become a trillion dollar company.”

Challenges And Competition

While the company may boast some advantages under a founder, it also faces challenges.

“Importantly, there can be some very good years of innovation and hypergrowth… but then there’s a list of things that can become distraction and it's just as important to surround a founder with strong business leaders and provide visibility into a longer term succession plan,” Huberty said.

In the long run, she expects Apple to rise as a Tesla competitor rather than a partner. And with expected R&D spend of $19 billion in 2020, the consumer-device company is poised for disruption.

“I see the end game as a vertically integrated solution and don’t expect Apple to partner with a company that sells a competing product,” Huberty said.

68,3 Dow Jones Stocks to Trade for the Technical Investor,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgiKfUcte9SoAHBHQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411807/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2f3-dow-jones-stocks-to-trade-for-the-technical-investor%2f/RK=2/RS=4MFgttwa7qPNzz3szf6cm0pSpoc-,2020-05-03 00:00:00,"Headlines can be fickle at best. But don’t fret. With more reliable price action indicating unfinished business for today’s bull market, let’s explore two Dow Jones stocks to buy and one to monitor for selling in case a second round of sell-offs comes to pass.

Tuesday’s headlines weren’t the positive signals long-term investors relish. Strong gains by the Dow Jones to start the week, prompted in part by promising novel coronavirus vaccine news from biotech Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA ), were quickly challenged as health experts offered skeptical criticism of the yesterday’s announcement.

The countering headlines saw Monday’s well-cheered gains of nearly 4% chipped away by a dip of 1.59% in the blue chip index. And unsurprisingly, many Dow Jones stocks fared even worse.

Still, when it comes to investing, there’s always the time-tested advice not to fight the Fed. And with the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell offering a positive outlook for the U.S. economy, and assuring investors the Fed still had plenty of ammunition in a TV interview over the weekend, a well-supported market is better than one that isn’t. Right?

The fact is there are no guarantees as to what news might come next. And mind you, just a week ago the Fed Chair was warning of a recession much larger than any since WWII.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL

(NASDAQ: Intel (NASDAQ: INTC

(NASDAQ: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO

Yet price action in the blue chip index has remained more positive than not, and well-positioned for another leg higher. And that’s important to respect, at least as long as it lasts. The possibility of a second bearish turn in May can’t be dismissed either. As much, let’s explore two Dow Jones stocks offering strong technical incentives to buy in today’s market and one stock to short, or certainly exit if long, should conditions take a turn for the worse.

Dow Jones Stocks to Trade: Apple (AAPL)

Source: Charts by TradingView

Our first Dow Jones stock is Apple. Unsurprisingly, AAPL is setting up as a “buy.”

The iconic retail brand’s resilience has been nothing short of impressive in the aftermath of March’s Covid-19 driven bear market. I guess we know where some of those stimulus checks may have been going.

Regardless of whether you’re on board with iPhones, AirPods and the likes, the fact is that Apple has been outperforming most other Dow components, plus the index as a whole, for the past several weeks.

That tenacity now has the stock setting up for an imminent breakout from a well-supported handle stationed in the upper region of its well-shaped, daily chart corrective cup base.

Intel (INTC)

Source: Charts by TradingView

Intel is the next of our Dow Jones stocks. Similar to Apple, the semiconductor giant is a “buy.” INTC is in fact ready for purchase right now.

Technically, shares of Intel broke out in Wednesday’s session from a high lateral congestion pattern formed the past few weeks as the stock challenged longer-term angular resistance.

Bottom-line, with resistance now overcome and weekly stochastics trending nicely higher within neutral territory to confirm today’s price action, this Dow component looks great to own today.

Shares have room to rally several percent before encountering its pre-correction and all-time-high. And from there, fresh all-time-highs this summer are waiting in the wings.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Source: Charts by TradingView

The last of our three Dow Jones stocks is Coca-Cola. Unlike our first two blue chip constituents, shares of Coke have been conspicuously weak since the March bottom. And KO stock could be under even greater bearish pressure in the days and weeks ahead.

Technically, a move back beneath last week’s low of $43.20 puts shares in much greater danger of trading aggressively lower. That type of weakness would mark a third failure of the stock’s long-standing uptrend line following March’s decisive, but oversold failure and April’s inside candlestick sporting a slight canary-like warning the worst may be yet to come.

To be clear, there’s key Fibonacci supports below the current share price for investors to potentially rally behind. This Dow Jones stock is also nearing oversold levels as evidenced by its monthly stochastics. Still, if you’re looking for a bear market somewhere, Coca-Cola is the unlucky place to be.

69,Better Buy: Roku vs. Apple,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgiKfUcte9SoAHhHQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByN3UwbTk1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM5BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411807/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.fool.com%2finvesting%2f2020%2f05%2f22%2fbetter-buy-roku-vs-apple.aspx%3fsource%3deptyholnk0000202%26utm_source%3dyahoo-host%26utm_medium%3dfeed%26utm_campaign%3darticle%26yptr%3dyahoo/RK=2/RS=0bvpNtCQmGEK6OQmpeGMvypX0Cc-,2020-05-22 00:00:00,"Let's make this short and sweet, dear reader. Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is a strong buy right now. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) isn't.

I see Roku as one of the best buys on the market today; I added to my Roku position in my personal portfolio as recently as March 17. This is a skyrocketing growth stock on the rise, and the COVID-19 crisis will only help Roku accelerate its business growth -- streaming media platforms are a hot ticket right now. That's simply the start of a long-term wealth-building investment idea.

Apple is a very different story. Cupertino always struck me as a one-trick pony, and that single horse looks mighty tired these days. The one-two punch of coronavirus fallout and the simmering Chinese-American trade war will add up to a terrible year for Apple, and the company's best days may already be behind it. I've never owned a single share of Apple, and that's not changing any time soon.

Not the Apple of my eye

You know Apple's single trick. iPhones and iPads accounted for 63% of Apple's total sales in the first half of fiscal year 2020. A large slice of the company's revenue from services also falls in this category, though Apple won't tell us exactly how much. Take away the iOS platform, and the company falls apart.

iPhone and iPad sales fell in the second quarter due to the economic stress and manufacturing infrastructure challenges that sprung from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, iPhone sales also plunged 14% lower in fiscal year 2019, long before the coronavirus reared its tragic head. Mobile computing has been a hot ticket over the last decade, but it gets harder and harder to whip up excitement around the next flagship iPhone these days. 5G networking might help for a while, but even that boost will be short-lived.

Ergo, the very foundation of Apple's financial platform is starting to crumble. Cupertino's trillion-dollar market cap looks fragile to me. And it's a long way down if and when the final descent starts.

Other Fools disagree, some of them passionately so. That's fine, and it's a core component of our ""Motley"" spirit. I'll change my mind when Apple comes up with a more diverse business plan. Until then, I'm not touching this stock with a 10-foot charging cable.

The winner, please

Let me reiterate how quickly Roku is growing up before our very eyes right now. The company is unprofitable, but only because Roku is investing every dime of spare cash into accelerated growth ideas. The set-top box maker has evolved into a software and service provider for several TV makers, and Roku is poised to wear that mantle for pretty much the entire consumer electronics industry within a few short years.

Yes, that's another one-trick pony. But this mare is young and healthy, and Roku's business prospects are skyrocketing. Revenue jumped 52% higher in fiscal year 2019, if you want to focus on the pre-COVID era again. Apple to apples, right?

And if the charts below are telling you to pick Apple's stock over Roku's, I'm afraid we'll disagree about pretty much everything when it comes to investing in growth stocks."

For a long time, Apple stock has tracked the performance of the company’s iPhone business.

The coronavirus pandemic just made a bad situation worse for Apple. The iPhone business already faced pressure from Huawei and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Apple has been working to diversify its revenue sources beyond iPhone sales. The company has placed a big focus on the service business. In fact, Apple is close to a revenue milestone in its services division this year.

Apple stock has gained 6.5% since the company reported record services revenue for the March quarter.

The company’s services include the Apple TV+ video streaming service, which launched in November 2019. Apple TV+ entered a crowded market dominated by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Now, the market has been disrupted by Disney+ from Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS).

Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people's location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic ""exposure notification"" system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

""User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,"" the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

LARGE SECTIONS OF THIS STATE'S ECONOMY DECIMATED FROM CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone's battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

""We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,"" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

A logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is seen at its headquarters in Hsinchu

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to answer ""serious questions"" about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's plans to build a U.S.-based $12 billion plant, flagging national security concerns and potentially undisclosed subsidies.

TSMC, the world's biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), announced the project last week, in a move trumpeted by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as signaling a ""renaissance in American manufacturing"" fueled by President Donald Trump.

In a letter addressed Tuesday to Ross and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and two colleagues said they ""strongly support"" efforts by the administration to ""on-shore"" semiconductor plants in the United States.

But Schumer, along with Patrick Leahy and Jack Reed, urged more transparency and asked the government to consider ""companies that already have built a significant presence in the U.S."", citing Micron (NASDAQ: ), GlobalFoundries and Cree (NASDAQ: ).

""We have serious questions as to how this project takes into consideration national security requirements and how it aligns with a broader strategy for building a diverse U.S. semiconductor manufacturing supply chain,"" the men wrote of the TSMC plan.

""We ask that you cease any such negotiations or discussions until you have briefed the relevant authorization and appropriations committees with your plans, including any commitments you have made to funding, tax breaks, licensures, or other incentives,"" they added.

Commerce, the Pentagon and TSMC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

TSMC, which is a key supplier to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, has found itself in the cross fire of a global technology battle between Washington and Beijing.

The Taiwanese firm will likely be hit by a new U.S. rule aimed at curbing global chip supplies to Huawei, which it placed on a black list last year on national security grounds. But the U.S. government also negotiated with TSMC for years to open a U.S.-based plant, Reuters reported, as it seeks to bring more chip manufacturing onshore."

(NASDAQ: FB) is planning to resume work in its offices starting July 6 at 25% occupancy, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

What Happened

The company is considering putting people on multiple shifts to meet social distancing requirements to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

It will also require employees to wear masks at all times in some locations, and only when in close proximity to others in the rest of the offices, Bloomberg learned.

The number of people in a meeting room at a time will be restricted, cafeteria buffets will be replaced with takeaway meals, gyms will be closed, and there will be 6-foot spaces between workstations, sources told Bloomberg. Outsiders will also be restricted from entering the office spaces.

Why It Matters

The social media giant has previously said any employee whose job doesn't require them to be present in the office can continue to work from home for the rest of the year.

Companies are planning a phased return to work as lockdowns across states in the United States are relaxed.

The two companies led by Jack Dorsey, Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) and Square Inc. (NYSE: SQ), said they would let employees work remotely permanently beyond the pandemic.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have extended the return to office work to October.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is planning an earlier return to normalcy, bringing back workers in phases starting late May.

Facebook Price Action

Now, Morgan Stanley reignited the debate by comparing Tesla to Apple 20 years ago.

Tesla versus Apple

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock bulls don’t like to see the company in the same league as automakers. Instead, they see Tesla as a technology company. They put Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Tesla’s peer group. As I have noted multiple times, the company lies somewhere between an automaker and a technology company. If anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has exemplified that Tesla is an automaker.

Now, Morgan Stanley reignited the debate about how the TSLA of today resembles Apple 20 years ago. There are similarities between the two companies.

Morgan Stanley on Tesla

Two Morgan Stanley analysts shared their views on TSLA and Apple. Katy Huberty, who follows Apple, said that tech investors “view Tesla in a way they viewed Apple 20 years ago: a company that thinks differently, that is incredibly innovative in a category that needs a spurt of innovation.”

She added, “That creates investor interest. If there’s a path to profitability and reason to believe scale will continue to increase, then tech investors tend to not care as much about valuation and/or are will to look multiple years into the future when scale and profitability will support current valuation.”

Tesla’s valuation

To be sure, “valuation purists” have always raised doubts about Tesla’s valuation. Ashwath Damodaran, popularly known as the “dean of valuation,” valued the company at a fraction of its current valuation. However, valuing TSLA is a lot different than valuing other companies. You have to look beyond the traditional valuation framework. This doesn’t suggest that the stock has probably run ahead of its fundamentals. Even CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the stock price is high!

Comparing the products

From a product perspective, both companies have industry-leading products. Tesla cars are a benchmark for the electric vehicle industry. Similarly, an Apple product stands out from other products. From software to the range, every new electric vehicle gets compared to a Tesla model. As I have argued previously, the comparisons give the company a free marketing platform.

I would add another aspect to the comparison between Apple 20 years ago and Tesla today. The electric vehicle industry is still in the nascent stage. However, all of the established automakers have been betting big on electrification. If the industry estimates are correct, we should see electric vehicles outselling internal combustion engines 20 years from now.

Electric vehicles

Here’s where Tesla has the lead. The brand represents electric vehicles. Traditional automakers find it hard to beat TSLA in the electric vehicle race despite all of their efforts. From an automaker selling a few thousand cars a year, Tesla guided for half a million electric vehicle sales this year. That said, we aren’t sure if the guidance holds ground after the pandemic impacted production at the Freemont plant.

Elon Musk

Overall, Elon Musk has a lot in common with Jeff Bezos. Read Tesla’s Musk and Amazon’s Bezos Have a Lot in Common to learn more.

Is Tesla a better buy than Apple? From a valuation standpoint, Apple looks better. Not to mention, Warren Buffett has Apple as Berkshire Hathaway’s biggest holding. However, Tesla stock is for believers. You need to believe in the electric vehicle story as well as Elon Musk before buying TSLA stock."

U.S. President Trump holds cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington 2/2

By Elizabeth Culliford

(Reuters) - The regulation of big technology companies such as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.

Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Donald Trump and his likely Democratic opponent Joe Biden on some key tech policy issues:

BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES

Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, regularly bashing Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos but meeting with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )'s Tim Cook, has said ""there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" when asked about big tech firms.

The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but both he and Biden have stopped short of calling for the firms to be broken up.

Biden has said dismantling companies like Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at.""

REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA

Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives.

Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its policies on political ads and manipulated videos, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a key internet law which largely exempts online platforms like Facebook and Twitter from legal liability for users' posts.

In 2018, Trump signed into law a bill that makes websites liable for third-party content that facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. But this year, in a win for tech firms, Trump also signed a trade deal that means tech companies will have U.S.-style liability protections for online content when operating in Mexico and Canada.

DATA PRIVACY

Congress has been trying to build consensus on a federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration has signaled support for. Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy ""standards not unlike the Europeans,"" an apparent reference to the European Union's stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Trump administration has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption, blasting Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals.

Privacy advocates have also slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants' privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data.

DIGITAL DIVIDE

The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.

Trump has said he is committed to ensuring ""every citizen can have high-speed internet access,"" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund.

Biden also said he plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations."

(NASDAQ: AAPL), CNBC reported on Tuesday.

The movie, starring Tom Hanks, was supposed to be released during the Father's Day weekend on June 19 before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic delayed the theater launch of all productions.

Greyhound will now be released directly on Apple TV+ following Sony's 15-year streaming rights deal with Apple, CNBC noted.

Sony's decision is in contrast with a majority of other producers who have simply chosen to delay the launch of their major films.

People familiar with the matter told CNBC that the Japanese conglomerate was worried ""that the film wouldn't be able to find a slot among the superhero films and franchises that had been delayed from the summer.""

Apple has shelled $70 million for the deal, according to CNBC. Sony was also in talks with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), the sources told CNBC, but wasn't willing to pay as much as the Cupertino-based consumer electronics giant.

Price Action

Sony's shares closed 1.6% lower at $63.05 on Tuesday and traded another 0.3% lower at $62.88 in the after-hours session.

Apple shares closed 0.6% lower at $313.14 in the regular session the same day but added 0.5% in the after-hours at $314.54."

Suffice to say, the numbers pertaining to last week were terrible, showing 2.44 million American workers filing for initial unemployment benefits.

The S&P 500 lost 0.78%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.41%

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.97%

fell 0.97% Recently resurgent Disney (NYSE: DIS ) succumbed to some profit-taking today, becoming the Dow’s worst offender.

Over the course of the novel coronavirus pandemic, investors have become accustomed to Thursday misery from the weekly jobless claims data, but the markets don’t always respond in kind. There have been days when stocks were drubbed on the claims data and others when equities rallied in spite of bleak numbers. Not-terrible losses put today somewhere in the middle.

The other source of pressure on equities today was the once again-eroding relationship between the U.S. and China. In a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate easily passed a bill, which could bar Chinese companies from listing on traditional U.S. exchanges, if it were to be passed.

As a result, reports surfaced that Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), the largest internet search company in China, is mulling pulling its shares from the Nasdaq and pursuing a listing closer to home.

In late trading, 23 of 30 Dow stocks were in the red, but each of the losers was off by less than 3%.

Yes, Really: Good News for Boeing

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) was the Dow leader after RBC analyst Michael Eisen initiated coverage of the aerospace stock with an “outperform” rating and a $164 price target.

Perhaps even more helpful to the Boeing stock cause today were comments from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) CEO Gary Kelly. At the airlines’ annual shareholders meeting today, Kelly said he’s hopeful the carrier can get its fleet of grounded Boeing 737 Max jets airborne again by the fourth quarter. That’s big news because Southwest is the largest 737 Max customer.

More Reasons to Love Apple

Already one of this year’s best-performing mega-cap names, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) still has ways to entice investors beyond the iPhone. An emerging theme for Apple is its services business and that segment’s growth could be spectacular.

In a note out today, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani detailed how Apple services could eventually be a $100 billion business unto itself. Though putting $100 billion into context, that number is still much less than the current market capitalization for fellow Dow tech stock International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ).

“Higher services mix should push gross margins higher and help smooth cyclicality. In addition, Apple continues to build its base of subscription services, which helps make the case for a higher multiple given the recurring nature of the cash flows…Net/net, services remains an underappreciated growth lever especially given the shift in growth towards monetization and subscription based model,” said Daryanani.

Ominous Dividend Call

The Dow is home to four financial services stocks, three of which closed lower today amid speculation that bank dividends are in danger. That trio includes JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) and American Express (NYSE: AXP ), though the latter isn’t a traditional bank.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said in an opinion piece that the $250 billion banks spent on dividends and buybacks last year would be better used to bolster their capital positions. For its part, JPM already nixed its share repurchase plan earlier this year.

Travelers (NYSE: TRV ) was the lone Dow financial stock in the green today because it’s an insurance company and because, well, it already boosted its dividend this year.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today

Given the past weeks of terribly unemployment numbers, we can easily surmise that when the May jobs report is delivered on the first Friday of June, it will be horrific. Perhaps not as bad as the 20.5 million jobs shed in the month of April, but the May number is still smoothly sailing into “ugly” territory.

Under some rosy estimates, 80% of the jobs lost due to the coronavirus pandemic will return. The issue there is two-fold. First, anything less than 100% is disappointing and bad for workers and the economy. Second is the length of time it will take for those jobs to come back.

80,Long-Term Trends Will Drive Square Stock Above $100 Soon,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AUVfQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByYnR1Zmd1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2flong-term-tailwinds-drive-sq-stock%2f/RK=2/RS=jhqsrUvw3SFC.xSLAZZ1w.Y5lW0-,2020-05-21 10:05:47-04:00,"Back in February, I recommended Square (NYSE: SQ ) stock as a play on a cashless future. In the short term, that call admittedly did not play out well.

Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com

In fact, SQ stock would lose about half its value in a matter of weeks. It was one of the biggest large-cap victims of the pandemic-driven panic that hit the market in late February and early March.

But markets found their bottom, and so did SQ. The stock now has doubled from its lows. Near $80, it actually trades modestly above where it did when I recommended it on Feb. 7.

From here, however, the bull case I laid out 3.5 months ago still holds. And while the company is going to face short-term headwinds, its promising future may arrive quicker than even bulls like myself thought at the beginning of the year.

It’s that long-term opportunity on which investors are starting to focus. That’s why Square stock has rallied. And it’s also why the stock has more room to run.

Yes, There Will Be a Short-Term Hit

There’s little doubt Square is going to face a short-term impact from the novel coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown.

In its first-quarter report earlier this month, Square withdrew its guidance for the full year. It declined to provide an outlook even for the second quarter.

What figures Square did disclose look worrisome. Earnings for the first quarter badly missed Wall Street estimates. The company said in its first-quarter shareholder letter that gross payment volume (GPV) declined 35% year-over-year in the last two weeks of the quarter.

The news got even worse in April. According to the Q1 conference call, GPV dropped 39% YOY in April. Small businesses drive nearly three-quarters of Square’s GPV, and many of those businesses were closed or saw plunging sales.

Looking to the near term, SQ stock simply looks dangerous. Indeed, that’s how traders initially reacted, as the stock fell sharply in early after-hours trading.

The Long-Term Benefit

But SQ would reverse those losses — and close the following day up nearly 10%. Investors did what they were supposed to do: They looked closely and took the long view.

From that perspective, the quarter actually looks bullish. The company’s Cash App saw enormous growth, with gross profit rising 115% year-over-year. Cash App seems to be outpacing rival Venmo, from PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), while even giants like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) lag far behind.

But it’s not just the results for Cash App in the quarter that matter. CEO Jack Dorsey said on the call that the number of Cash App direct deposit accounts rose from 3 million in February to 14 million in April.

That’s stunning growth. And that growth will have a beneficial impact over the long term. In less than three months, Square picked up millions of new users. It saw many existing users expand the usefulness of their accounts.

Those customers are exceedingly valuable. Excluding cryptocurrency transactions, Cash App gross margins are close to 80%. That alone accelerates the long-term case for SQ stock.

SQ Stock and the Cashless Future

It’s also worth taking a step back. Again, SQ is a play on a cashless future. That future probably arrives quicker than we thought.

After all, cash transactions are going to be less popular going forward. More sales will be transacted online and through apps. That’s a huge boon to Square’s long-term potential.

There’s even some help coming from costs. Square is following Dorsey’s other company, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), in enacting a permanent work-from-home policy. Given labor and office costs in the San Francisco Bay Area, that policy can provide a significant boost to margins in the future.

Take the Long View With Square

Again, Square is going to have take a short-term hit. Q2 results are going to be ugly. We may see some lingering effects into Q3 and Q4 as well.

But good investors don’t look a quarter out. Good companies don’t, either.

They take the long view. And the long view shows not only that digital payments are going to be the future, but that the future is going to arrive more quickly than we thought.

There will be more than one winner. Indeed, PYPL stock now is up 40% so far this year. I’ve recommended Visa (NYSE: V ) for similar reasons.

But Square is going to be one of those winners. That’s what I believed in February, and it’s certainly what I believe now. As normalcy returns, that will become clear to even more investors. And SQ stock will do a lot more than just recover its losses — it will set new highs.

81,Extra Space Storage: A Great Place To Keep Your Cash (NYSE:EXR),https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AU1fQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByM3V1YTVuBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMzBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fseekingalpha.com%2farticle%2f4348386-extra-space-storage-great-place-to-keep-your-cash/RK=2/RS=KeqJY.bbDDFOP6nl.UZ1XBPrF0Q-,2020-05-18 10:30:51+00:00,"Known as a boring but recession-resistant segment of commercial real estate, we'll convincingly demonstrate self-storage is still thriving and that Extra Space is among, if not the best.

While a few headwinds certainly exist, this sector's challenges are much gentler than those facing the broader economy. Extra Space's collection and occupancy data through April 30th support this claim.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Past Performance Guarantees Nothing But Says A Lot

The final summary point referenced self-storage's reputation as boring without the ""pizzazz"" of Class A downtown office buildings, sprawling hotel complexes, or other trophy real estate assets. Real estate tycoons want skyscrapers in their marketing materials, not a self-storage facility with decaying boats pressed against an off-kilter barbwire fence.

Source

As of the end of 2019, Extra Space's (EXR) 10-year total shareholder return was 1,179%, or, if my math is correct (the online calculator I default to can't go over 20% so I had to do this one the old-fashioned way), a ~29% annualized return. This isn't a micro-cap technology company either; BBB rated Extra Space closed 2019 with 1,817 properties encompassing 140 million square feet and a $14.7 billion market capitalization. In terms of 10-year total shareholder return, those stats make this self-storage company #1 compared to all publicly-traded REITs and #11 among the entire S&P 500 index beating out Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Self-storage doesn't sound so boring now, does it?

An investor doesn't require many winners like Extra Space to transform a good portfolio into a great one. There are caveats to this return profile we should be mindful of. Up until relatively recently, institutional ownership in the self-storage asset class was minimal. In fact, institutional investors were responsible for just 5% of larger transactions (>$2.5 million) in 2015. That figure surpassed 15% in 2018 and continues to rise. Consequently, a large portion of self-storage facilities are independently owned and operated and lack significant scale, financing capabilities, unit pricing optimization software, marketing budgets, and other competitive advantages more sophisticated operations implement.

We'll use another type of real estate to put this into context. Consider Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT) purchasing a larger family-owned hotel with decent rental revenue per available room (""REVpar""), a small but reliable base of business travelers, and a moderate amount of overdue capital expenditures (""CapEx""). After Hilton purchases the hotel and puts its name on the front door, several things happen immediately. Now that it's part of Hilton's reward and branding system, business travelers increase 50% within 90 days.

Hilton's vast experience enables it to optimize the impact of a modest $500,000 capital investment to improve the property's primary weaknesses. The rental rates are now determined and updated in real-time through Hilton's proprietary algorithm using data the previous owner would never have access to. Combined, these easy changes improve occupancy by 25% and room rates by 35% during the workweek. The property's value to any one of the 17 hotel REITs in the NAREIT index doubles from the price Hilton paid 90 days ago since the 10-year cash flow generation is now much greater.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

This is a simple example of how an experienced institutional investor adds value to a commercial property by bringing it under its umbrella. Unlike hotels, self-storage was 95% owned by comparatively unsophisticated individual investors just 10 years ago.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Institutional investors are increasingly active, and so a portion of that ""arbitrage"" has eroded, but much of it remains. This market is ripe for consolidation with Public Storage (PSA) and Extra Space arguably the best positioned to capitalize as well discuss.

When it comes to the future performance potential of Extra Space and other peers like Public Storage, it's not realistic to expect the outstanding performance of the past but self-storage is well-positioned to be among the best property sectors over the next decade.

Portfolio And Operations

Just over half (51%) of Extra Space facilities are wholly owned with property management services provided on another 36% and the remaining 13% owned through a joint venture (""JV"").

The firm is well-diversified geographically and doesn't have immense exposure to New York or California where the commercial real estate market seems the most volatile during the current crisis.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Extra Space has proven itself as a lean and efficient operator as demonstrated by class-leading 7.1% same-store net operating income (""NOI"") growth. Life Storage (LSI) and CubeSmart (CUBE) are the other peers included above and have market capitalizations of $4.0 and $4.6 billion, respectively.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Extra Space's growth core funds from operations (""FFO"") is the primary driver of the extremely impressive aforementioned return profile. Public Storage's 300% increase in core FFO is a distant second but still a very strong metric relative to almost all other investment grade REITs with meaningful market capitalizations.

Provided they can afford to do so, many established companies are investing in renewables and other areas considered to be socially or environmentally conscious. In some cases, these are strictly financial decisions while others are primarily to bolster the firm's image. Extra Space accomplishes both through 43% of its wholly-owned stores using solar power. Given many facilities have a high percentage of flat roof square footage and offer temperature-controlled environments (areas with the highest cost electricity tend to have the best solar rebates, e.g. California, and most of the load is needed to power air conditioning during the day - a perfect fit for solar panels), it makes sense for Extra Space to consider solar power. This also allows the firm to start presentations with their environmentally responsible activities, arguably helping the brand and relationship with certain jurisdictions.

Balance Sheet And Liquidity

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Balance sheets are inherently a snapshot in time. While a single quarter or year's numbers are helpful, the analysis cannot be complete without looking back over several years. The above metrics have stayed consistent since 2015 with most of the variance due to the maturation and refinancing of debt coupled with mergers and acquisition (""M&A"") activity. All these metrics are at least good though we'd prefer to see the fixed charge coverage ratio back above 4.0, net debt/EBITDA below 5.5, and fixed debt as a percentage of total debt closer to 90%. Extra Space's credit profile and BBB (two notches above junk) is strong but as fortified as Public Storage and its A2 rating. Then again, no REIT has a better credit rating than Public Storage.

Extra Space has approximately $650 million in liquidity comprised of cash and revolver capacity.

Dividends & Their Drivers

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

We often state that all equity value eventually comes down to cash flow. Even an asset-heavy firm is priced based on the cash flow resulting from the sale of those assets discounted for how far that is anticipated to be in the future. While core FFO is not a perfect measure and nor is NOI, they are good gauges and both have been increasing markedly for Extra Space. This means Extra Space can responsibly and sustainably increase its dividend. Since 2014, Extra Space has nearly doubled (91.5%) its cash dividends to shareholders.

The company's formula is simple but effective: rapidly grow store count using a financially disciplined strategy while increasing same-store NOI in the mid-to-high single digits annually. Store counts rose from under 800 in 2009 to over 1800 currently. As long as this strategy is maintained, Extra Space can continually increase distributions and uphold a responsible payout ratio.

One unique aspect of Extra Space's business is the degree it serves as a third-party operator for self-storage properties it does not own. Though CUBE has quickly embraced the strategy, Extra Space remains number one with 646 managed third-party stores. This enables the REIT to obtain better overall margins and a more diversified revenue stream than it would otherwise.

Another differentiator leverages Extra Space's broad expertise in all areas of this real estate segment: bridge lending on select self-storage properties. This lending program is limited to completed buildings to mitigate development risk and all properties must meet Extra Space's acquisition requirements. Per the 10-Q supplemental filing, Extra Space closed $21.5 million in bridge loans in Q1, with an additional $92.1 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. Extra Space waives prepayment penalties if it acquires the property and part of the deal is they serve as the third-party operator.

This is yet another acquisition channel but disguised as a bridge lending program. Given Extra Space is the operator, it knows the property's fundamentals better than the competition and perhaps even the owner. As the lender, it knows granular details of the leverage profile, deed, and the financial condition of the owner. By waiving the prepayment penalty, the owner is incentivized to sell to Extra Space if the timeliness of the transaction is a concern. In other words, the deck is stacked in Extra Space's favor every time.

Q1 Financials And 2020 Outlook

EXR generated $1.24 in FFO per share in Q1, representing a 6.9% increase compared to the same period in 2019. Same-store revenue increased 1.9% while same-store occupancy fell only 60 basis points (0.60%) over the last year which is a solid metric. 93% of April rents were collected which was down 5% from 2019. We can expect that number to fluctuate in Q2 and Q3 but it is unlikely to fall meaningfully further due to the supply and demand mechanics in the market. EXR has approximately $650 million in immediately liquidity, which while sufficient for the $11 billion market capitalization company, is lower than we'd prefer (and likely management too).

Unlike many companies issuing equity to bolster their balance sheets, EXR is taking advantage of the sharp sell-off in their stock and repurchased $52.2 million in shares in Q1 with another $347.8 million available under the plan. This activity has the potential to augment FFO per share and other key metrics by one to four percent.

Management withdrew 2020 guidance but Q1's distribution of $0.90 equates to a 4.4% annual yield with a conservative 72.6% FFO payout ratio. The $0.90 was the same as Q4 2019's.

We've talked about self-storage's development into a legitimate sector within commercial real estate but let's take a moment to point out a few important nuances. In part due to the returns companies like Extra Space had been delivering, new development in self-storage increased rapidly after the economy stabilized from the Great Recession. Its popularity grew as well with nearly 10% of the U.S. population now owning a storage unit. In fact, there are more self-storage facilities in the U.S. than McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) combined times two.

This graph of the San Antonio market reflects a nationwide trend as new development projects continued to over-supply the market through 2018. The degree of over-capacity was moderate and tended to negatively impact rental rates more so than occupancy. I maintain a good relationship and dialogue with the CEO of one of the larger private self-storage companies. We trade information and thoughts on the sector since I periodically conduct due diligence on self-storage investment opportunities for large, insitutional investors. Last week he and I discussed this exact topic and his on-the-ground experience mimics what I've read elsewhere: the excess supply in self-storage both in the U.S. and Canada has lessened considerably.

Another tailwind is average lease length has slowly ratcheted higher over the years. This is a powerful trend as customers that stay for multiple years are among the most profitable. This allows REITs like Public Space and Extra Storage to maintain better occupancy and with less marketing and re-leasing dollars. Outside of ensuring climate control measures, long-term tenants require minimal work or expenditures on behalf of Extra Space.

Technology is also quickly penetrating the self-storage market with the coronavirus only accelerating the trend. This further reduces leasing and personnel costs while simultaneously improving customer experience. As an example, clients can now fill out an application, receive approval, and access their new storage unit without talking to, much less meeting with, an individual. Extra Space maintains 11 data scientists, 17 digital marketing employees, has a Google executive on their advisory board, and had over 39 million website views last year.

Special Considerations And Valuation

In terms of governance, Extra Space has followed many of the guidelines set by institutional investors including having a separate chairman and CEO, at least two thirds independent directors, shareholders' ability to amend bylaws, and an annual advisory meeting to approve executive compensation. Like Public Storage, Extra Space's embrace of environmentally-friendly technology, such as photovoltaic panels, is advantageous overall and especially to European investors.

From a valuation perspective, Extra Space trades in line with Public Storage and 10% higher than its smaller peers LSI and CUBE. PSA and EXR also yield approximately the same at ~4.5%. The higher growth rate and better operating metrics of EXR are offset by Public Storage's more solid financial profile resulting in near-identical valuations and dividend yields. Although we like LSI and CUBE, we think EXR and PSA currently offer the best risk-adjusted returns. These two storage REITs also have the highest probability of maintaining and potentially raising their 2020 cash distributions.

We reserve our Crisis Buy Range and individual stock risk ratings for subscribers but suffice to say that investors do not need EXR to experience another sharp fall to obtain it a favorable valuation. From current levels, EXR is set up for well over a 50% total return when it eventually reaches its previous high around $120. Keep in mind that this REIT has posted the #1 investor total return of all REITs in the past decade, generated higher FFO in Q1 2020 than in Q1 2019, and maintains a conservative distribution payout ratio of <75%.

82,7 Tech Stocks That Are Bolstered by Contact Tracing Initiatives,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AVVfQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByc3RzMXFjBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM0BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2f7-contact-tracing-tech-stocks%2f/RK=2/RS=Cun8_2SbVKrG1tS.mbKQ7KSdGWE-,2020-05-07 00:00:00,"[Editor’s Note: This article was updated on May 22, 2020, to update information about the availability of Conduent’s contact tracing tool.]

Contact tracing is a time-tested strategy for tracking the spread of viruses (like the novel coronavirus) in an effort to prevent community spread. Effective contract tracing typically requires a small army of boots on the ground to locate individuals and, when necessary, persuade them to be tested.

As the world begins to re-open, many of the world’s technology companies are developing solutions that will allow digital contact tracing. And some tech stocks have reaped the rewards of these initiatives. However, when it comes to the private medical information of millions of Americans, the question changes from “could there be an app for that?” to “should there be an app for that?”

And there are more concerns when it comes to getting Americans back to work. After all, it’s one thing to ask the general public to opt into an app. It’s quite another to have digital contact tracing applied in an enterprise setting. The pros are that it can decipher where an employee has been and who they have been in contact with. This would enable companies to tell them to go home and isolate themselves if they are at high risk for contracting the virus.

Right now, there are more questions than answers. Will it make employees feel safer? Does it work on a large scale? And most importantly, is it even legal?

These are questions that will take many years to work out. In the meantime, many of the world’s leading technology companies are working to develop a framework, at the very least, for effective digital contract tracing. Some of these companies include the following:

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )

(NASDAQ: ) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG GOOGL )

(NASDAQ: ) Alibaba (NYSE: BABA )

(NYSE: ) Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS: TCEHY )

(OTCMKTS: ) SAP SE (NYSE: SAP )

(NYSE: ) Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS: DTEGY )

(OTCMKTS: ) Conduent (NASDAQ: CNDT )

Let’s take a closer look at what these more prominent names are doing and why each of these tech stocks should be on your radar now.

Tech Stocks to Watch: Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG)

Initially Apple created a Covid-19 screening tool that could be accessed via the internet or through an app. The screening tool was created in partnership with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The limitation of the screening tool is that it requires individuals to self-report. This is one of the largest privacy concerns about digital contract tracing.

Now Apple is collaborating with Google to create an app that will alert users if they have been in contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus. This will ensure that the app that will work seamlessly with Apple’s iOS operating system and Android operating systems. The two tech giants are working to strengthen privacy protections and will not use GPS location data.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the proposal is “the most concrete technological solutions to date for governmental authorities searching for ways to at least partially lift the lockdown orders that have swept the nation.”

Despite the security measures put in place, the app is drawing criticism for potentially sharing too much private health data.

In contrast to the privacy concerns in the United States, China was able to develop contract tracing without regard to how it might infringe on individual rights. China’s primary digital payment channels are Alipay from Alibaba and WeChat from Tencent Holdings.

The payment channels already track the consumer activity of hundreds of millions of users. As the outbreak became a pandemic, Alibaba and Tencent developed QR code systems for smartphones to scan. This allows authorities to designate individuals who pose a health risk and those who are free to use public spaces and transportation. The system assigned users either a green, yellow or red indicator to indicate what an individual needed/was permitted to do.

SAP SE (SAP) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY)

Meanwhile in Europe, SAP SE and Deutsche Telekom are building a contract tracing app for the country. Originally the date from the app was going to be stored on a central server. However, due to privacy concerns, the companies are following a model based on similar principles to the Apple and Google app. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said, “A decentralized solution would create more trust among users.”

In an email concurrent with the announcement, SAP said, “Deutsche Telekom and SAP will play their part in Germany and throughout Europe to ensure that European technologies are a central component in the effective fight against coronavirus.”

Conduent (CNDT)

Conduent is a lesser-known company among the other tech stocks mentioned here. But the company created software solutions for tracking cases of Ebola, SARS, STDs and AIDS. And the company has also created a similar solution for contract tracking of Covid-19.

The software works with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure to track the spread of Covid-19 in more than a dozen jurisdictions. Conduent’s software works primarily with public health agencies at the state, city and county levels to streamline and automate contact tracing for case management.

83,7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy With Fortress-Like Balance Sheets,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AV1fQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBya2cwZmh2BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM1BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2f7-dow-jones-stocks-to-buy-with-fortress-like-balance-sheets%2f/RK=2/RS=RfYPttCeGAwlRybVqbCLpmDGDYs-,2020-05-07 00:00:00,"The markets popped May 18 on the news a vaccine for the novel coronavirus was getting closer to reality. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 3.9% rise that day, investors looking for Dow Jones stocks to buy might want to consider those with fortress-like balance sheets.

The reason is simple. The stock markets are still significantly overvalued. Year to date through May 18, the Dow Jones has a total return of 13.8%, while the S&P 500 is down 8.6%.

Oaktree Capital Management co-founder Howard Marks told CNBC in April that once the Federal Reserve stops providing help for the economy, we’re in for a second correction.

“We’re only down 15% from the all-time high of Feb. 19. It seems to me the world is more than 15% screwed up,” Marks told CNBC April 20. “People are traumatized, and not just because of the performance of their stocks … Everybody’s life is hugely changed.”

Billionaire investor David Tepper, who owns the NFL’s Carolina Panthers, believes this market is more expensive than every other time in history except for 1999.

That’s a bold statement. And something worthy of investor consideration. I too worry about the markets getting ahead of themselves.

Visa (NYSE: V

(NYSE: Nike (NYSE: NKE

(NYSE: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ

(NYSE: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT

(NASDAQ: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL

(NASDAQ: McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD

(NYSE: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO

For this reason, if you’re looking for Dow Jones stocks to buy, I would consider these seven because they all have great balance sheets.

Dow Jones Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)

Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com

The world’s largest payment processor reported healthy earnings at the end of April that was very healthy, with 7% sales growth along with 6% earnings growth. Further, despite CEO Alfred Kelly admitting that the coronavirus is going to mess with its business for the next few quarters, its business model is alive and well and worth investing.

Visa has net debt of $5.7 billion and trailing 12-month free cash flow of $11.9 billion. Based on an enterprise value of $431.5 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.8%.

That’s not cheap based on historical valuations, but as my InvestorPlace colleague Faisal Humayun said earlier in May, the company’s free cash flow should continue to grow. Add to this a beta of less than 1.0 and you’ve got a rock-solid Dow Jones component.

If you’re looking for a stock that analysts like, Visa would be at the top of the list. Covered by 35 analysts, 26 rate its stock a buy, another four rate it as overweight, six have it as a hold and none rate it underweight or a sell.

Nike (NKE)

Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com

“Just do it” could be the theme for NKE stock. Of all 30 of the Dow Jones stocks, NKE has the seventh-best 5-year cumulative return through May 19 of 80%.

People can’t seem to get enough of their Nike’s in good times and bad. People were lining up in Atlanta recently to get the latest stuff from the Portland company, amazingly, while we’re still in the middle of a pandemic.

“Nike had a line of ~40 people on both Friday and Saturday,” Raymond James analysts wrote May 19. “The store was running at capacity (50 people it appeared) and more than 15 people were checking out on both days and at different times (equally registering footwear and apparel).”

While it’s great to see people back shopping, I’ve selected Nike because of its fortress-like balance sheet.

The company has net debt of $3.5 billion and trailing 12-month free cash flow of $3.4 billion. Based on an enterprise value of $145.8 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.3%. More importantly, Nike’s total debt is just 25% of its assets, leaving it in good shape to fight the coronavirus.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com

Johnson & Johnson has had its fair share of public relations nightmares because of its talc-based baby powder. On May 19, the company announced that it was ending the sale of the product in the U.S. and Canada on weak demand. The company continues to defend the safety of its product.

“Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder. Decades of scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of our product,” Johnson & Johnson’s press release stated. “We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom. All verdicts against the Company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.”

The company continues to sell a cornstarch-based baby powder in North America. Both products are available outside North America.

Regardless of where you stand on this issue, Johnson & Johnson remains a trusted producer of consumer brands that include Aveeno, Band-Aid, Listerine, Tylenol and many more. And even though the consumer health segment is likely the best known, it accounts for just 18% of overall sales.

As for the company’s balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson has net debt of $9.6 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $17.8 billion and total debt is just 18% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $402.4 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com

A common theme among the business media right now is that big business is going to get even bigger post-pandemic.

“The pandemic is playing to the strengths of the biggest digital players, as seen in their earnings results for the quarter ending in March. Amazon.com Inc. has gone on a hiring spree to keep up with a surge in demand from millions of homebound consumers,” Bloomberg Quint contributor David McLaughlin stated in early May. “What is normally a slow quarter, sales jumped 26% to a record $75.5 billion, though earnings fell 29% compared with the same period in 2019.”

Another major theme during Covid-19 is that cloud-based companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft will continue to do well as more people permanently work from home.

InvestorPlace’s Tom Taulli recently argued that Microsoft is the right play post-pandemic. He based this argument on the fact the coronavirus has had little effect on its business during one of the bleakest economic periods in U.S. history.

Taulli points out that Microsoft Teams’ daily active users have more than doubled since March to 75 million. Large organizations are jumping on boards. This product is a big reason I suggested in October 2019 that Slack (NYSE: WORK ) should be worried about Microsoft focusing on team collaboration.

As for the company’s balance sheet, Microsoft has net cash of $63.8 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $43.4 billion, and total debt is just 26% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $1.3 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 3.3%.

It’s a treasure trove of riches.

Apple (AAPL)

Speaking of a treasure trove of riches, Apple shareholders have it pretty good. Here are some of the numbers to back this up.

Apple has net debt of $15.5 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $66.6 billion and total debt is 34% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $1.37 trillion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.9%.

InvestorPlace advisor Louis Navellier recently suggested that Apple will continue to confound expectations by making money during a global recession. With an assist from Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan, Navellier suggests Apple could actually grow revenues in fiscal 2020, despite the fact the world is being massively disrupted.

“Part of it is Apple’s diversified nature. While it made its bones on smartphones and computers, Apple has successfully grown its Services revenue in recent quarters to the point that it can help sustain the company even when a pandemic shuts down its factories and grinds supply lines to a halt,” Navellier wrote May 19.

The rise of services in the Apple ecosystem does not surprise me. Back in February 2017, I was extolling their virtues, suggesting that the gross margins of this segment of its business, given their recurring nature, would push its stock to $200.

At the time, it was trading around $129. It has more than doubled in the three years since.

McDonald’s (MCD)

Source: Nixx Photography / Shutterstock.com

I don’t know if this will surprise you, but of the 30 Dow Jones stocks, McDonald’s has the fifth-best cumulative return over the past five years at 87.2%. Microsoft takes top honors, up 291.9% over the same period.

On April 30, McDonald’s reported Q1 2020 earnings fell 17% to $1.47 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.57 a share. On the top line, its sales were $4.71 billion, $60 million higher than the consensus estimate, but 6% lower than a year earlier.

That’s about what you’d expect during a global pandemic and stay-at-home orders throughout most of the country. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the company’s conference call that it doesn’t expect business to snap right back as its various markets reopen. It expects that its breakfast daypart, which has become an anchor of its business, has a big challenge ahead of it.

However, the familiarity of the Golden Arches will get it through its latest struggle.

McDonald’s has net debt of $46.9 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.3 billion and total debt is 103% of its assets. While that might appear high, it includes almost $13 billion in short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities (rent). It won’t have any trouble paying those.

Based on an enterprise value of $180.5 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.9%. While I wouldn’t classify MCD stock as cheap, over the long haul, it’s proven it can deliver the goods.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Source: focal point / Shutterstock.com

Year to date, Coca-Cola has a total return of -18.8%. Meanwhile, its biggest rival, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ), has a total return of -2.9%, significantly better. A big reason has to do with the fact Pepsi has a food business (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats) that has been able to generate more business while everyone’s working from home, gorging on snacks and oatmeal.

However, if you’re interested in a fortress-like balance sheet to get you through this pandemic relatively intact, Coke is it.

Coca-Cola has net debt of $32.7 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $8.3 billion and total debt is 54% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $224 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 3.7%.

Something interesting happened to Coca-Cola over the past five years.

While its sales fell 16% between 2015 and 2019, its net margins increased from 17% to almost 24%, a 700-basis-point increase. It did this by going to an asset-light business model, where others owned its bottling plants. In 2015, it made $7.4 billion on $44.3 billion in sales. Fast forward to 2019. It made $9.0 billion on $37.3 billion in sales. It made $1.6 billion more on $7 billion less in sales.

That’s quite a feat.

While the company continues to generate growth from the Coca-Cola brand, it is also making acquisitions to diversify its revenues, such as the 2019 purchase of Costa Coffee. The combination of smart growth with robust expense control will ensure KO stock rewards shareholders, like Warren Buffett, for years to come.

Now Jim Cramer said the most dominant names in technology emerged as the latest stock group to lead the market higher in Wednesday’s session.

“These Big Tech stocks led us higher,” the “Mad Money” host said after the major averages staged a strong rally.

“This market’s been going through leadership groups like there’s no tomorrow.”

Cramer has been undoubtedly referring to the rapid-fire oscillations that investors are witnessing over the last few weeks, as stock indexes struggle to break through key technical levels amid ongoing economic uncertainty and a still rampant coronavirus pandemic.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 369 points, or 1.52% Wednesday, as the S&P 500 scrapped out a 1.67% gain. But the champion of the three was the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite which climbed 2.08% to finish the day.

While the market has undergone some changes as there have been breakouts in the consumer staples, health care, essential big-box retailer, and semiconductor sectors during different periods, as the U.S. has continued to fight the coronavirus pandemic, now it may be tech’s turn according to Cramer.

“And now it’s FAANG’s turn,” Cramer said, referring to the acronym for the group of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google parent Alphabet stock.

So far, nearly 100 Apple stores around the world have reopened with extensive changes, including temperature checks at the door, more frequent deep cleanings and requirements that staff and shoppers wear face coverings . Apple is also limiting the number of people allowed in stores and will begin curbside drop-off and pick-up options at some locations, according to a statement the company released Sunday.

Reopening an Apple store takes planning that depends on multiple factors, said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people.

""We look at every available piece of data — including local cases, near and long‑term trends, and guidance from national and local health officials,"" she wrote in the statement.

The White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, co-chaired by White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, called for “an unprecedented investment in digital infrastructure.” Members include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty.

The board “was focused on solving these challenges even prior to covid 19, but the pandemic has accelerated our need to take action,” said Barbara Humpton, CEO of Siemens USA.

The board’s efforts are aimed at helping connect displaced workers with pathways to upgrade their skills and learn new ones so they can move into “good jobs in rebounding fields as the health crisis abates and the economy begins to recover,” according to a White House official briefed on the plan.

The board wants governments “to streamline occupational licensing, education requirements, reduce the cost of licensing, and increase reciprocity” and urges the federal government to “allow student financial aid for high-quality, short-term, market-aligned credential programs.”

Workforce issues have taken on new importance as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the economy.

The United States lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.

In a statement, Ross said the advisory board’s meeting comes at a “challenging” time, but expressed confidence the president’s policies will lead to a rapid rebound.

Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find “solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.”

“By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,” IBM’s Rometty said in a statement.

Four major companies - Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Salesforce (CRM.N), IBM and Workday Inc (WDAY.O) - are announcing Tuesday they are creating “Interoperable Learning Records” to help workers and employers match applicants with jobs, the official said."
87,Warren Buffett Isn’t Buying Because You Soon May Need the Cash,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AX1fQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByN3UwbTk1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM5BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2fwarren-buffett-coronavirus-insurance-losses-berkshire%2f/RK=2/RS=UzHnBXV0AWTqW7Tn0JrOF97JrSk-,2020-05-20 09:06:25-04:00,"There is a good reason why Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) haven’t been “taking advantage” of the novel coronavirus.

You may need the cash.

Insurance brokers at Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW ) have spun several scenarios for losses on insurance resulting from Covid-19. If the crisis is ending it could be a wash.

But if the virus returns in the fall, and this winds up like the 1918 flu, there could be $80 billion in losses. There’s even an “extreme” scenario with $140 billion in losses.

Most of Berkshire’s assets are held in insurance companies. Some you know, like GEICO. Most you don’t, like General Re, biBERK Business Insurance, Gateway Underwriters and National Indemnity. The parent company needs to backstop all of them. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire had $137 billion of cash at the end of March.

Warren Buffett Doesn’t See Any Bargains

There’s another reason why Warren Buffett isn’t tossing around cash right now.

The Federal Reserve has pumped so much new money into the economy that there are no bargains. A company that does work, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), sells for nearly 25 times earnings. Even companies that are temporarily out of business, like Carnival (NYSE: CCL ), are being snapped up.

The whole idea of value investing, which Buffett has practiced from the start of his career, is that you buy assets below their intrinsic value. With so much free money running around, such assets don’t exist.

The best values this year have been in government bonds. A three-month Treasury had an interest rate of 1.5% at the start of the year. Today it’s 0.1%. An older bond, with a real interest rate, thus has intrinsic value to the holder.

So-called “inflation-protected” securities now carry negative rates. There’s talk of more negative rates coming, government bonds paying less than their face value.

Will Insurance Cover the Coronavirus?

The biggest question in the insurance industry is whether business interruption insurance will cover Covid-19. Exclusions on many insurers’ standard forms don’t mention viruses at all.

Many of these questions will go to court. Some insurers will argue that the virus isn’t “physical damage.” The specific language of an insurance contract, which many business owners don’t clearly understand, will drive a process that has just begun. The legal process will continue long after the virus is gone.

The biggest potential losses in the Willis scenario involve the path the U.S. seems to be on, which it calls “limited success.” This assumes governments lift social distancing rules over economic losses and the virus spreads until controlled by “herd immunity.”

In this case, Willis projects $92 billion of losses in workers’ compensation, $27 billion in losses from economic liability claims, $22.7 billion from event cancellations and losses in other lines.

The Bottom Line

Warren Buffett is in the position J. P. Morgan was over a century ago. He’s the ultimate economic backstop. During the 2008 financial crisis, that meant opportunity. His willingness to backstop banks let the U.S. financial system heal and brought Berkshire Hathaway huge profits.

The current crisis is made for insurance. Berkshire Hathaway companies must shoulder the enormous losses caused by Covid-19. Otherwise the economy can’t recover.

Berkshire Hathaway seems capable of doing that. But that could nearly wipe out earnings in the near term. Some of the smaller companies Berkshire owns may also become victims of the virus.

Berkshire is being very conservative in the current crisis, in the best possible way. That’s good for all businesses. But in the near term it’s bad for Berkshire Hathaway.

Berkshire stock looks cheap now, but as the extent of the damage becomes clear it could fall well below intrinsic value.

Buy it then.

88,Paypal Finds Its Stride Thanks to the Coronavirus,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXnCerUcte314AYVfQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTBzdmVvZmlwBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMxMAR2dGlkAwRzZWMDc3I-/RV=2/RE=1590411819/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2fpaypal-stock-finds-its-stride-thanks-to-the-coronavirus%2f/RK=2/RS=BxFDRnwEbkNMtO4BAZ9gd8sM3Oo-,2020-05-20 11:13:07-04:00,"Most stocks are struggling to claw their way back from the damage caused by the novel coronavirus. When investors panicked in March, the markets suffered record losses. Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL ) stock was lumped in with the rest.

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com

Paypal lost nearly a third of its value in four weeks, but that’s where the similarities end. Paypal didn’t just move toward recovery. Its stock exploded into growth territory.

At this point, PYPL has left its pre-crash levels in the dust.

Paypal stock is now up 39% in 2020. It has already matched its 2019 performance, a 31% gain, despite being less than halfway through the year and the chaos caused by the coronavirus.

Benefiting From the Coronavirus Pandemic

The key to the rapid recovery and growth in PYPL stock this year is directly related to the coronavirus pandemic. While most companies have seen their business take a big hit during the lockdown, very few have actually benefited.

The example most people think of is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ). With employees increasingly working from home, the popularity of video conferencing software went through the roof. Zoom was easy to use and offered a fee tier. It became the go-to solution.

Zoom stumbled a few times because of security concerns, but Zoom stock — which ended 2019 just about where it started after its IPO earlier that year — posted triple-digit growth so far in 2020.

Paypal is in a similar situation, in that the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown happen to play into its business model. Online shopping. Contactless payment. Transferring money electronically to friends and family in order to avoid touching cash.

This is exactly what Paypal and its Venmo mobile payment solution are designed for. The Internal Revenue Service even allowed recipients to receive their $1,200 stimulus check through a mobile payment app, including Venmo.

Paypal CEO Daniel Schulman told Fortune that not only had his company seen a “tremendous surge,” in business, but he saw it as something that will outlast the pandemic. “We’re not going to go backwards to what was. We’re not going to be using cash nearly as much,” said Shulman.

Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff agrees. He told Politico the crisis is “absolutely going to drive people to prefer credit and debit to cash.”

It’s Not Just Paypal

Of course, Paypal isn’t the only company that’s benefiting from the rapid shift to online shopping and contactless payment. At the end of April, Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ) reported a 40% increase in contactless payments. In April, Bloomberg reported that use of contactless payment systems including Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay were skyrocketing.

What About a Recession?

The downside in being a company like Paypal is the potential hit to your business when the economy swings into a recession. With job losses not seen in generations, a recession is a virtual guarantee at this point. Depending on how deep the coronavirus damage is to the economy, odds are we’ll be facing a full-blown depression.

In both cases, consumers are likely to tighten their spending. And that will have a negative impact on Paypal. The questions are how bad will it be, and how long will it last?

The Bottom Line on Paypal Stock

There are few companies as well positioned as Paypal to benefit from the coronavirus pandemic’s upending of consumer shopping behavior. Paypal is an established payment option for many e-commerce websites. It can be used for contactless payment in many retail locations and is accepted by many popular food delivery services. Paypal’s Venmo is popular for transferring cash, and its digital wallet can even be used to receive a stimulus payment.

The “tremendous surge” in Paypal use has resulted in big gains for PYPL stock. The prospect of consumer spending slowing down is a risk worth noting, but it’s not spooking investment analysts. Of the 41 surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, Paypal is a consensus buy with 32 rating the stock a “buy” and three rating it “overweight.”

(NASDAQ: AAPL), CNBC reported on Tuesday.

The movie, starring Tom Hanks, was supposed to be released during the Father's Day weekend on June 19 before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic delayed the theater launch of all productions.

Greyhound will now be released directly on Apple TV+ following Sony's 15-year streaming rights deal with Apple, CNBC noted.

Sony's decision is in contrast with a majority of other producers who have simply chosen to delay the launch of their major films.

People familiar with the matter told CNBC that the Japanese conglomerate was worried ""that the film wouldn't be able to find a slot among the superhero films and franchises that had been delayed from the summer.""

Apple has shelled $70 million for the deal, according to CNBC. Sony was also in talks with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), the sources told CNBC, but wasn't willing to pay as much as the Cupertino-based consumer electronics giant.

Price Action

Sony's shares closed 1.6% lower at $63.05 on Tuesday and traded another 0.3% lower at $62.88 in the after-hours session.

Apple shares closed 0.6% lower at $313.14 in the regular session the same day but added 0.5% in the after-hours at $314.54."

Some of these same tech powers, and the industry in general, have picked up right where they left off during the market’s two-month rally.

The S&P 500 has surged 32% from its March 23 lows, as Wall Street looks ahead to a coronavirus recovery. On top of that, investors remain in ‘don’t fight the Fed’ mode as the central bank does all it can to support the market, as the U.S. government provides economic stimulus.

Meanwhile, stocks jumped to start the week on the back of positive coronavirus vaccine news. This came as economies around the world slowly begin to reopen from their coronavirus-induced lockdowns.

That said, the full impact of the coronavirus shutdown won’t be seen until second quarter earnings, and the economic data seems sure to get worse. Still, as stocks jump, for all the reasons we mentioned, investors might want to consider buying some of the safer tech plays.

These come in the form of blue-chip giants such as Amazon AMZN, which hit new highs Wednesday, as its e-commerce and cloud spaces prove somewhat immune to the coronavirus. So here are 3 blue-chip tech stocks that investors might want to buy…

Facebook FB

FB hit new highs Wednesday after it announced its new Shops offering that will enable users and businesses to essentially create a streamlined version of their e-commerce sites directly on Facebook and some of its other services. FB’s latest e-commerce push comes as retailers around the world struggle, and is part of its larger push, through Marketplace and Instagram, to compete in a growing market against Amazon, eBay EBAY, Etsy ETSY, and others.

Facebook in April said it would pay $5.7 billion for roughly 10% of Indian telecom powerhouse Jio Platforms Ltd. The move is bet on the huge Indian market where FB already has over 400 million WhatsApp users. Plus, the social media power posted solid Q1 results, with daily active users up 11% to 1.73 billion. This growth helped Facebook’s Q1 revenue pop 18% to reach $17.74 billion. And executives also calmed Wall Street nerves about its advertising sales during the coronavirus.

Despite its 60% climb since mid-March and sitting right near new highs, FB stock is trading at a discount against its own one-year highs. Facebook’s balance sheet is also strong and its cash pile will help it weather any coronavirus storms and continue its expansion into e-commerce, augmented reality, and more.

FB is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that longer-term investors might want to look at because its nearly 2.6 billion monthly users makes it an advertising titan, especially in an age where people pay not to see ads on Netflix NFLX and elsewhere.

Apple AAPL

Apple is clearly another safe tech bet at the moment despite pandemic-related iPhone setbacks. AAPL beat our Q2 fiscal 2020 estimates at the end of April, driven by growth in its non-iPhone units. Apple’s services division saw its revenue jump roughly 17%. Meanwhile, its wearables unit climbed 23% to a new quarterly record. Perhaps more importantly, given the unprecedented times, Apple closed the period with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities, alongside total debt of $110 billion. This left it with $83 billion in net cash.

Apple also lifted its quarterly dividend by 6% and its current 1.03% yield easily tops the 10-year U.S. Treasury’s 0.66%. On top of all of that, Apple’s board authorized a $50 billion increase to the stock buyback program, at a time when fellow giants such as AT&T T suspended their repurchase programs.

Shares of Apple have surged 40% since March 23 and it currently sits just 3% below its 52-week highs. AAPL is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now that sports “B” grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. Even near its highs, longer-term investors will likely look back in a year from now and wish they could buy Apple at its current price.

Microsoft MSFT

Microsoft is another obvious pick that also topped our quarterly earnings and revenue estimates at the end of April, with sales up 15%. Cloud computing was the star of the show once again, with Intelligent Cloud sales up 27% for the second quarter in a row. MSFT’s cloud segment pulled in $12.3 billion, which was the most of its three units. Meanwhile, its Office-heavy Productivity and Business Processes jumped 15%, with personal computing up 3%."

MSFT’s cloud segment pulled in $12.3 billion, which was the most of its three units. Meanwhile, its Office-heavy Productivity and Business Processes jumped 15%, with personal computing up 3%.

Microsoft’s cloud business is an industry leader alongside Amazon. And its Office 365 suite remains vital to businesses, governments, schools, and consumers. More recently, its Teams business has stood out during the stay-at-home environment, and it looks ready to take on smaller rivals like Slack WORK and Zoom ZM. On top of that, Microsoft held over $137 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at the end of last quarter.

MSFT’s dividend yield rests at 1.1% right now, and it might continue to buy back stock. Looking ahead, Microsoft’s current full-year revenue is projected to jump 12.4% and another 10% next year. MSFT’s adjusted earnings are projected to surge 20% and 9.2%, respectively. And Microsoft, which is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now, has seen its stock price climb 36% since the market’s lows and it’s currently trying to break through to new highs.

Suffice to say, the numbers pertaining to last week were terrible, showing 2.44 million American workers filing for initial unemployment benefits.

The S&P 500 lost 0.78%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.41%

The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.97%

fell 0.97% Recently resurgent Disney (NYSE: DIS ) succumbed to some profit-taking today, becoming the Dow’s worst offender.

Over the course of the novel coronavirus pandemic, investors have become accustomed to Thursday misery from the weekly jobless claims data, but the markets don’t always respond in kind. There have been days when stocks were drubbed on the claims data and others when equities rallied in spite of bleak numbers. Not-terrible losses put today somewhere in the middle.

The other source of pressure on equities today was the once again-eroding relationship between the U.S. and China. In a rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate easily passed a bill, which could bar Chinese companies from listing on traditional U.S. exchanges, if it were to be passed.

As a result, reports surfaced that Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ), the largest internet search company in China, is mulling pulling its shares from the Nasdaq and pursuing a listing closer to home.

In late trading, 23 of 30 Dow stocks were in the red, but each of the losers was off by less than 3%.

Yes, Really: Good News for Boeing

Boeing (NYSE: BA ) was the Dow leader after RBC analyst Michael Eisen initiated coverage of the aerospace stock with an “outperform” rating and a $164 price target.

Perhaps even more helpful to the Boeing stock cause today were comments from Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) CEO Gary Kelly. At the airlines’ annual shareholders meeting today, Kelly said he’s hopeful the carrier can get its fleet of grounded Boeing 737 Max jets airborne again by the fourth quarter. That’s big news because Southwest is the largest 737 Max customer.

More Reasons to Love Apple

Already one of this year’s best-performing mega-cap names, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) still has ways to entice investors beyond the iPhone. An emerging theme for Apple is its services business and that segment’s growth could be spectacular.

In a note out today, Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani detailed how Apple services could eventually be a $100 billion business unto itself. Though putting $100 billion into context, that number is still much less than the current market capitalization for fellow Dow tech stock International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM ).

“Higher services mix should push gross margins higher and help smooth cyclicality. In addition, Apple continues to build its base of subscription services, which helps make the case for a higher multiple given the recurring nature of the cash flows…Net/net, services remains an underappreciated growth lever especially given the shift in growth towards monetization and subscription based model,” said Daryanani.

Ominous Dividend Call

The Dow is home to four financial services stocks, three of which closed lower today amid speculation that bank dividends are in danger. That trio includes JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) and American Express (NYSE: AXP ), though the latter isn’t a traditional bank.

Kristalina Georgieva, managing director at the International Monetary Fund, said in an opinion piece that the $250 billion banks spent on dividends and buybacks last year would be better used to bolster their capital positions. For its part, JPM already nixed its share repurchase plan earlier this year.

Travelers (NYSE: TRV ) was the lone Dow financial stock in the green today because it’s an insurance company and because, well, it already boosted its dividend this year.

Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today

Given the past weeks of terribly unemployment numbers, we can easily surmise that when the May jobs report is delivered on the first Friday of June, it will be horrific. Perhaps not as bad as the 20.5 million jobs shed in the month of April, but the May number is still smoothly sailing into “ugly” territory.

Under some rosy estimates, 80% of the jobs lost due to the coronavirus pandemic will return. The issue there is two-fold. First, anything less than 100% is disappointing and bad for workers and the economy. Second is the length of time it will take for those jobs to come back.

93,Long-Term Trends Will Drive Square Stock Above $100 Soon,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgyK0UctesQMADlLQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByNDZ0aWFxBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM2BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411828/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2flong-term-tailwinds-drive-sq-stock%2f/RK=2/RS=9W1KAFPtHYzGKTrY8.2rQQdrD_M-,2020-05-21 10:05:47-04:00,"Back in February, I recommended Square (NYSE: SQ ) stock as a play on a cashless future. In the short term, that call admittedly did not play out well.

Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com

In fact, SQ stock would lose about half its value in a matter of weeks. It was one of the biggest large-cap victims of the pandemic-driven panic that hit the market in late February and early March.

But markets found their bottom, and so did SQ. The stock now has doubled from its lows. Near $80, it actually trades modestly above where it did when I recommended it on Feb. 7.

From here, however, the bull case I laid out 3.5 months ago still holds. And while the company is going to face short-term headwinds, its promising future may arrive quicker than even bulls like myself thought at the beginning of the year.

It’s that long-term opportunity on which investors are starting to focus. That’s why Square stock has rallied. And it’s also why the stock has more room to run.

Yes, There Will Be a Short-Term Hit

There’s little doubt Square is going to face a short-term impact from the novel coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown.

In its first-quarter report earlier this month, Square withdrew its guidance for the full year. It declined to provide an outlook even for the second quarter.

What figures Square did disclose look worrisome. Earnings for the first quarter badly missed Wall Street estimates. The company said in its first-quarter shareholder letter that gross payment volume (GPV) declined 35% year-over-year in the last two weeks of the quarter.

The news got even worse in April. According to the Q1 conference call, GPV dropped 39% YOY in April. Small businesses drive nearly three-quarters of Square’s GPV, and many of those businesses were closed or saw plunging sales.

Looking to the near term, SQ stock simply looks dangerous. Indeed, that’s how traders initially reacted, as the stock fell sharply in early after-hours trading.

The Long-Term Benefit

But SQ would reverse those losses — and close the following day up nearly 10%. Investors did what they were supposed to do: They looked closely and took the long view.

From that perspective, the quarter actually looks bullish. The company’s Cash App saw enormous growth, with gross profit rising 115% year-over-year. Cash App seems to be outpacing rival Venmo, from PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL ), while even giants like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) lag far behind.

But it’s not just the results for Cash App in the quarter that matter. CEO Jack Dorsey said on the call that the number of Cash App direct deposit accounts rose from 3 million in February to 14 million in April.

That’s stunning growth. And that growth will have a beneficial impact over the long term. In less than three months, Square picked up millions of new users. It saw many existing users expand the usefulness of their accounts.

Those customers are exceedingly valuable. Excluding cryptocurrency transactions, Cash App gross margins are close to 80%. That alone accelerates the long-term case for SQ stock.

SQ Stock and the Cashless Future

It’s also worth taking a step back. Again, SQ is a play on a cashless future. That future probably arrives quicker than we thought.

After all, cash transactions are going to be less popular going forward. More sales will be transacted online and through apps. That’s a huge boon to Square’s long-term potential.

There’s even some help coming from costs. Square is following Dorsey’s other company, Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), in enacting a permanent work-from-home policy. Given labor and office costs in the San Francisco Bay Area, that policy can provide a significant boost to margins in the future.

Take the Long View With Square

Again, Square is going to have take a short-term hit. Q2 results are going to be ugly. We may see some lingering effects into Q3 and Q4 as well.

But good investors don’t look a quarter out. Good companies don’t, either.

They take the long view. And the long view shows not only that digital payments are going to be the future, but that the future is going to arrive more quickly than we thought.

There will be more than one winner. Indeed, PYPL stock now is up 40% so far this year. I’ve recommended Visa (NYSE: V ) for similar reasons.

But Square is going to be one of those winners. That’s what I believed in February, and it’s certainly what I believe now. As normalcy returns, that will become clear to even more investors. And SQ stock will do a lot more than just recover its losses — it will set new highs.

While a few headwinds certainly exist, this sector's challenges are much gentler than those facing the broader economy. Extra Space's collection and occupancy data through April 30th support this claim.

Past Performance Guarantees Nothing But Says A Lot

The final summary point referenced self-storage's reputation as boring without the ""pizzazz"" of Class A downtown office buildings, sprawling hotel complexes, or other trophy real estate assets. Real estate tycoons want skyscrapers in their marketing materials, not a self-storage facility with decaying boats pressed against an off-kilter barbwire fence.

Source

As of the end of 2019, Extra Space's (EXR) 10-year total shareholder return was 1,179%, or, if my math is correct (the online calculator I default to can't go over 20% so I had to do this one the old-fashioned way), a ~29% annualized return. This isn't a micro-cap technology company either; BBB rated Extra Space closed 2019 with 1,817 properties encompassing 140 million square feet and a $14.7 billion market capitalization. In terms of 10-year total shareholder return, those stats make this self-storage company #1 compared to all publicly-traded REITs and #11 among the entire S&P 500 index beating out Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B), and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Self-storage doesn't sound so boring now, does it?

An investor doesn't require many winners like Extra Space to transform a good portfolio into a great one. There are caveats to this return profile we should be mindful of. Up until relatively recently, institutional ownership in the self-storage asset class was minimal. In fact, institutional investors were responsible for just 5% of larger transactions (>$2.5 million) in 2015. That figure surpassed 15% in 2018 and continues to rise. Consequently, a large portion of self-storage facilities are independently owned and operated and lack significant scale, financing capabilities, unit pricing optimization software, marketing budgets, and other competitive advantages more sophisticated operations implement.

We'll use another type of real estate to put this into context. Consider Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT) purchasing a larger family-owned hotel with decent rental revenue per available room (""REVpar""), a small but reliable base of business travelers, and a moderate amount of overdue capital expenditures (""CapEx""). After Hilton purchases the hotel and puts its name on the front door, several things happen immediately. Now that it's part of Hilton's reward and branding system, business travelers increase 50% within 90 days.

Hilton's vast experience enables it to optimize the impact of a modest $500,000 capital investment to improve the property's primary weaknesses. The rental rates are now determined and updated in real-time through Hilton's proprietary algorithm using data the previous owner would never have access to. Combined, these easy changes improve occupancy by 25% and room rates by 35% during the workweek. The property's value to any one of the 17 hotel REITs in the NAREIT index doubles from the price Hilton paid 90 days ago since the 10-year cash flow generation is now much greater.

This is a simple example of how an experienced institutional investor adds value to a commercial property by bringing it under its umbrella. Unlike hotels, self-storage was 95% owned by comparatively unsophisticated individual investors just 10 years ago.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Institutional investors are increasingly active, and so a portion of that ""arbitrage"" has eroded, but much of it remains. This market is ripe for consolidation with Public Storage (PSA) and Extra Space arguably the best positioned to capitalize as well discuss.

When it comes to the future performance potential of Extra Space and other peers like Public Storage, it's not realistic to expect the outstanding performance of the past but self-storage is well-positioned to be among the best property sectors over the next decade.

Portfolio And Operations

Just over half (51%) of Extra Space facilities are wholly owned with property management services provided on another 36% and the remaining 13% owned through a joint venture (""JV"").

The firm is well-diversified geographically and doesn't have immense exposure to New York or California where the commercial real estate market seems the most volatile during the current crisis.

Extra Space has proven itself as a lean and efficient operator as demonstrated by class-leading 7.1% same-store net operating income (""NOI"") growth. Life Storage (LSI) and CubeSmart (CUBE) are the other peers included above and have market capitalizations of $4.0 and $4.6 billion, respectively.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Extra Space's growth core funds from operations (""FFO"") is the primary driver of the extremely impressive aforementioned return profile. Public Storage's 300% increase in core FFO is a distant second but still a very strong metric relative to almost all other investment grade REITs with meaningful market capitalizations.

Provided they can afford to do so, many established companies are investing in renewables and other areas considered to be socially or environmentally conscious. In some cases, these are strictly financial decisions while others are primarily to bolster the firm's image. Extra Space accomplishes both through 43% of its wholly-owned stores using solar power. Given many facilities have a high percentage of flat roof square footage and offer temperature-controlled environments (areas with the highest cost electricity tend to have the best solar rebates, e.g. California, and most of the load is needed to power air conditioning during the day - a perfect fit for solar panels), it makes sense for Extra Space to consider solar power. This also allows the firm to start presentations with their environmentally responsible activities, arguably helping the brand and relationship with certain jurisdictions.

Balance Sheet And Liquidity

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

Balance sheets are inherently a snapshot in time. While a single quarter or year's numbers are helpful, the analysis cannot be complete without looking back over several years. The above metrics have stayed consistent since 2015 with most of the variance due to the maturation and refinancing of debt coupled with mergers and acquisition (""M&A"") activity. All these metrics are at least good though we'd prefer to see the fixed charge coverage ratio back above 4.0, net debt/EBITDA below 5.5, and fixed debt as a percentage of total debt closer to 90%. Extra Space's credit profile and BBB (two notches above junk) is strong but as fortified as Public Storage and its A2 rating. Then again, no REIT has a better credit rating than Public Storage.

Extra Space has approximately $650 million in liquidity comprised of cash and revolver capacity.

Dividends & Their Drivers

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

We often state that all equity value eventually comes down to cash flow. Even an asset-heavy firm is priced based on the cash flow resulting from the sale of those assets discounted for how far that is anticipated to be in the future. While core FFO is not a perfect measure and nor is NOI, they are good gauges and both have been increasing markedly for Extra Space. This means Extra Space can responsibly and sustainably increase its dividend. Since 2014, Extra Space has nearly doubled (91.5%) its cash dividends to shareholders.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

The company's formula is simple but effective: rapidly grow store count using a financially disciplined strategy while increasing same-store NOI in the mid-to-high single digits annually. Store counts rose from under 800 in 2009 to over 1800 currently. As long as this strategy is maintained, Extra Space can continually increase distributions and uphold a responsible payout ratio.

Source: Extra Space Citi Global Property CEO Conference

One unique aspect of Extra Space's business is the degree it serves as a third-party operator for self-storage properties it does not own. Though CUBE has quickly embraced the strategy, Extra Space remains number one with 646 managed third-party stores. This enables the REIT to obtain better overall margins and a more diversified revenue stream than it would otherwise.

Another differentiator leverages Extra Space's broad expertise in all areas of this real estate segment: bridge lending on select self-storage properties. This lending program is limited to completed buildings to mitigate development risk and all properties must meet Extra Space's acquisition requirements. Per the 10-Q supplemental filing, Extra Space closed $21.5 million in bridge loans in Q1, with an additional $92.1 million under agreement to close in 2020 and 2021. Extra Space waives prepayment penalties if it acquires the property and part of the deal is they serve as the third-party operator.

This is yet another acquisition channel but disguised as a bridge lending program. Given Extra Space is the operator, it knows the property's fundamentals better than the competition and perhaps even the owner. As the lender, it knows granular details of the leverage profile, deed, and the financial condition of the owner. By waiving the prepayment penalty, the owner is incentivized to sell to Extra Space if the timeliness of the transaction is a concern. In other words, the deck is stacked in Extra Space's favor every time.

Q1 Financials And 2020 Outlook

EXR generated $1.24 in FFO per share in Q1, representing a 6.9% increase compared to the same period in 2019. Same-store revenue increased 1.9% while same-store occupancy fell only 60 basis points (0.60%) over the last year which is a solid metric. 93% of April rents were collected which was down 5% from 2019. We can expect that number to fluctuate in Q2 and Q3 but it is unlikely to fall meaningfully further due to the supply and demand mechanics in the market. EXR has approximately $650 million in immediately liquidity, which while sufficient for the $11 billion market capitalization company, is lower than we'd prefer (and likely management too).

Unlike many companies issuing equity to bolster their balance sheets, EXR is taking advantage of the sharp sell-off in their stock and repurchased $52.2 million in shares in Q1 with another $347.8 million available under the plan. This activity has the potential to augment FFO per share and other key metrics by one to four percent.

Management withdrew 2020 guidance but Q1's distribution of $0.90 equates to a 4.4% annual yield with a conservative 72.6% FFO payout ratio. The $0.90 was the same as Q4 2019's.

We've talked about self-storage's development into a legitimate sector within commercial real estate but let's take a moment to point out a few important nuances. In part due to the returns companies like Extra Space had been delivering, new development in self-storage increased rapidly after the economy stabilized from the Great Recession. Its popularity grew as well with nearly 10% of the U.S. population now owning a storage unit. In fact, there are more self-storage facilities in the U.S. than McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) combined times two.

This graph of the San Antonio market reflects a nationwide trend as new development projects continued to over-supply the market through 2018. The degree of over-capacity was moderate and tended to negatively impact rental rates more so than occupancy. I maintain a good relationship and dialogue with the CEO of one of the larger private self-storage companies. We trade information and thoughts on the sector since I periodically conduct due diligence on self-storage investment opportunities for large, insitutional investors. Last week he and I discussed this exact topic and his on-the-ground experience mimics what I've read elsewhere: the excess supply in self-storage both in the U.S. and Canada has lessened considerably.

Another tailwind is average lease length has slowly ratcheted higher over the years. This is a powerful trend as customers that stay for multiple years are among the most profitable. This allows REITs like Public Space and Extra Storage to maintain better occupancy and with less marketing and re-leasing dollars. Outside of ensuring climate control measures, long-term tenants require minimal work or expenditures on behalf of Extra Space.

Technology is also quickly penetrating the self-storage market with the coronavirus only accelerating the trend. This further reduces leasing and personnel costs while simultaneously improving customer experience. As an example, clients can now fill out an application, receive approval, and access their new storage unit without talking to, much less meeting with, an individual. Extra Space maintains 11 data scientists, 17 digital marketing employees, has a Google executive on their advisory board, and had over 39 million website views last year.

Special Considerations And Valuation

In terms of governance, Extra Space has followed many of the guidelines set by institutional investors including having a separate chairman and CEO, at least two thirds independent directors, shareholders' ability to amend bylaws, and an annual advisory meeting to approve executive compensation. Like Public Storage, Extra Space's embrace of environmentally-friendly technology, such as photovoltaic panels, is advantageous overall and especially to European investors.

Source: Public Filings & Williams Equity Research (""WER"")

From a valuation perspective, Extra Space trades in line with Public Storage and 10% higher than its smaller peers LSI and CUBE. PSA and EXR also yield approximately the same at ~4.5%. The higher growth rate and better operating metrics of EXR are offset by Public Storage's more solid financial profile resulting in near-identical valuations and dividend yields. Although we like LSI and CUBE, we think EXR and PSA currently offer the best risk-adjusted returns. These two storage REITs also have the highest probability of maintaining and potentially raising their 2020 cash distributions.

We reserve our Crisis Buy Range and individual stock risk ratings for subscribers but suffice to say that investors do not need EXR to experience another sharp fall to obtain it a favorable valuation. From current levels, EXR is set up for well over a 50% total return when it eventually reaches its previous high around $120. Keep in mind that this REIT has posted the #1 investor total return of all REITs in the past decade, generated higher FFO in Q1 2020 than in Q1 2019, and maintains a conservative distribution payout ratio of <75%.

95,7 Tech Stocks That Are Bolstered by Contact Tracing Initiatives,https://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=AwrXgyK0UctesQMAElLQtDMD;_ylu=X3oDMTByMXM3OWtoBGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwM4BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1590411828/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2finvestorplace.com%2f2020%2f05%2f7-contact-tracing-tech-stocks%2f/RK=2/RS=CW_5fk.xwxYGXoi3jH0y_Ce3sPU-,2020-05-07 00:00:00,"[Editor’s Note: This article was updated on May 22, 2020, to update information about the availability of Conduent’s contact tracing tool.]

Contact tracing is a time-tested strategy for tracking the spread of viruses (like the novel coronavirus) in an effort to prevent community spread. Effective contract tracing typically requires a small army of boots on the ground to locate individuals and, when necessary, persuade them to be tested.

As the world begins to re-open, many of the world’s technology companies are developing solutions that will allow digital contact tracing. And some tech stocks have reaped the rewards of these initiatives. However, when it comes to the private medical information of millions of Americans, the question changes from “could there be an app for that?” to “should there be an app for that?”

And there are more concerns when it comes to getting Americans back to work. After all, it’s one thing to ask the general public to opt into an app. It’s quite another to have digital contact tracing applied in an enterprise setting. The pros are that it can decipher where an employee has been and who they have been in contact with. This would enable companies to tell them to go home and isolate themselves if they are at high risk for contracting the virus.

Right now, there are more questions than answers. Will it make employees feel safer? Does it work on a large scale? And most importantly, is it even legal?

These are questions that will take many years to work out. In the meantime, many of the world’s leading technology companies are working to develop a framework, at the very least, for effective digital contract tracing. Some of these companies include the following:

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )

(NASDAQ: ) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG GOOGL )

(NASDAQ: ) Alibaba (NYSE: BABA )

(NYSE: ) Tencent Holdings (OTCMKTS: TCEHY )

(OTCMKTS: ) SAP SE (NYSE: SAP )

(NYSE: ) Deutsche Telekom (OTCMKTS: DTEGY )

(OTCMKTS: ) Conduent (NASDAQ: CNDT )

Let’s take a closer look at what these more prominent names are doing and why each of these tech stocks should be on your radar now.

Tech Stocks to Watch: Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG)

Initially Apple created a Covid-19 screening tool that could be accessed via the internet or through an app. The screening tool was created in partnership with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The limitation of the screening tool is that it requires individuals to self-report. This is one of the largest privacy concerns about digital contract tracing.

Now Apple is collaborating with Google to create an app that will alert users if they have been in contact with anyone infected with the coronavirus. This will ensure that the app that will work seamlessly with Apple’s iOS operating system and Android operating systems. The two tech giants are working to strengthen privacy protections and will not use GPS location data.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the proposal is “the most concrete technological solutions to date for governmental authorities searching for ways to at least partially lift the lockdown orders that have swept the nation.”

Despite the security measures put in place, the app is drawing criticism for potentially sharing too much private health data.

Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY)

In contrast to the privacy concerns in the United States, China was able to develop contract tracing without regard to how it might infringe on individual rights. China’s primary digital payment channels are Alipay from Alibaba and WeChat from Tencent Holdings.

The payment channels already track the consumer activity of hundreds of millions of users. As the outbreak became a pandemic, Alibaba and Tencent developed QR code systems for smartphones to scan. This allows authorities to designate individuals who pose a health risk and those who are free to use public spaces and transportation. The system assigned users either a green, yellow or red indicator to indicate what an individual needed/was permitted to do.

SAP SE (SAP) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY)

Meanwhile in Europe, SAP SE and Deutsche Telekom are building a contract tracing app for the country. Originally the date from the app was going to be stored on a central server. However, due to privacy concerns, the companies are following a model based on similar principles to the Apple and Google app. Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said, “A decentralized solution would create more trust among users.”

In an email concurrent with the announcement, SAP said, “Deutsche Telekom and SAP will play their part in Germany and throughout Europe to ensure that European technologies are a central component in the effective fight against coronavirus.”

Conduent (CNDT)

Conduent is a lesser-known company among the other tech stocks mentioned here. But the company created software solutions for tracking cases of Ebola, SARS, STDs and AIDS. And the company has also created a similar solution for contract tracking of Covid-19.

The software works with Amazon’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure to track the spread of Covid-19 in more than a dozen jurisdictions. Conduent’s software works primarily with public health agencies at the state, city and county levels to streamline and automate contact tracing for case management.

96,7 Dow Jones Stocks to Buy With Fortress-Like Balance Sheets,https://investorplace.com/2020/05/7-dow-jones-stocks-to-buy-with-fortress-like-balance-sheets/,2020-05-07 00:00:00,"The markets popped May 18 on the news a vaccine for the novel coronavirus was getting closer to reality. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s 3.9% rise that day, investors looking for Dow Jones stocks to buy might want to consider those with fortress-like balance sheets.

The reason is simple. The stock markets are still significantly overvalued. Year to date through May 18, the Dow Jones has a total return of 13.8%, while the S&P 500 is down 8.6%.

Oaktree Capital Management co-founder Howard Marks told CNBC in April that once the Federal Reserve stops providing help for the economy, we’re in for a second correction.

“We’re only down 15% from the all-time high of Feb. 19. It seems to me the world is more than 15% screwed up,” Marks told CNBC April 20. “People are traumatized, and not just because of the performance of their stocks … Everybody’s life is hugely changed.”

Billionaire investor David Tepper, who owns the NFL’s Carolina Panthers, believes this market is more expensive than every other time in history except for 1999.

That’s a bold statement. And something worthy of investor consideration. I too worry about the markets getting ahead of themselves.

Visa (NYSE: V

(NYSE: Nike (NYSE: NKE

(NYSE: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ

(NYSE: Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT

(NASDAQ: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL

(NASDAQ: McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD

(NYSE: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO

For this reason, if you’re looking for Dow Jones stocks to buy, I would consider these seven because they all have great balance sheets.

Dow Jones Stocks to Buy: Visa (V)

The world’s largest payment processor reported healthy earnings at the end of April that was very healthy, with 7% sales growth along with 6% earnings growth. Further, despite CEO Alfred Kelly admitting that the coronavirus is going to mess with its business for the next few quarters, its business model is alive and well and worth investing.

Visa has net debt of $5.7 billion and trailing 12-month free cash flow of $11.9 billion. Based on an enterprise value of $431.5 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.8%.

That’s not cheap based on historical valuations, but as my InvestorPlace colleague Faisal Humayun said earlier in May, the company’s free cash flow should continue to grow. Add to this a beta of less than 1.0 and you’ve got a rock-solid Dow Jones component.

If you’re looking for a stock that analysts like, Visa would be at the top of the list. Covered by 35 analysts, 26 rate its stock a buy, another four rate it as overweight, six have it as a hold and none rate it underweight or a sell.

Nike (NKE)

Source: mimohe / Shutterstock.com

“Just do it” could be the theme for NKE stock. Of all 30 of the Dow Jones stocks, NKE has the seventh-best 5-year cumulative return through May 19 of 80%.

People can’t seem to get enough of their Nike’s in good times and bad. People were lining up in Atlanta recently to get the latest stuff from the Portland company, amazingly, while we’re still in the middle of a pandemic.

“Nike had a line of ~40 people on both Friday and Saturday,” Raymond James analysts wrote May 19. “The store was running at capacity (50 people it appeared) and more than 15 people were checking out on both days and at different times (equally registering footwear and apparel).”

While it’s great to see people back shopping, I’ve selected Nike because of its fortress-like balance sheet.

The company has net debt of $3.5 billion and trailing 12-month free cash flow of $3.4 billion. Based on an enterprise value of $145.8 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.3%. More importantly, Nike’s total debt is just 25% of its assets, leaving it in good shape to fight the coronavirus.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)

Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com

Johnson & Johnson has had its fair share of public relations nightmares because of its talc-based baby powder. On May 19, the company announced that it was ending the sale of the product in the U.S. and Canada on weak demand. The company continues to defend the safety of its product.

“Johnson & Johnson remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder. Decades of scientific studies by medical experts around the world support the safety of our product,” Johnson & Johnson’s press release stated. “We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom. All verdicts against the Company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.”

The company continues to sell a cornstarch-based baby powder in North America. Both products are available outside North America.

Regardless of where you stand on this issue, Johnson & Johnson remains a trusted producer of consumer brands that include Aveeno, Band-Aid, Listerine, Tylenol and many more. And even though the consumer health segment is likely the best known, it accounts for just 18% of overall sales.

As for the company’s balance sheet, Johnson & Johnson has net debt of $9.6 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $17.8 billion and total debt is just 18% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $402.4 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT)

Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com

A common theme among the business media right now is that big business is going to get even bigger post-pandemic.

“The pandemic is playing to the strengths of the biggest digital players, as seen in their earnings results for the quarter ending in March. Amazon.com Inc. has gone on a hiring spree to keep up with a surge in demand from millions of homebound consumers,” Bloomberg Quint contributor David McLaughlin stated in early May. “What is normally a slow quarter, sales jumped 26% to a record $75.5 billion, though earnings fell 29% compared with the same period in 2019.”

Another major theme during Covid-19 is that cloud-based companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Microsoft will continue to do well as more people permanently work from home.

InvestorPlace’s Tom Taulli recently argued that Microsoft is the right play post-pandemic. He based this argument on the fact the coronavirus has had little effect on its business during one of the bleakest economic periods in U.S. history.

Taulli points out that Microsoft Teams’ daily active users have more than doubled since March to 75 million. Large organizations are jumping on boards. This product is a big reason I suggested in October 2019 that Slack (NYSE: WORK ) should be worried about Microsoft focusing on team collaboration.

As for the company’s balance sheet, Microsoft has net cash of $63.8 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $43.4 billion, and total debt is just 26% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $1.3 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 3.3%.

It’s a treasure trove of riches.

Apple (AAPL)

Speaking of a treasure trove of riches, Apple shareholders have it pretty good. Here are some of the numbers to back this up.

Apple has net debt of $15.5 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $66.6 billion and total debt is 34% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $1.37 trillion, it has a free cash flow yield of 4.9%.

InvestorPlace advisor Louis Navellier recently suggested that Apple will continue to confound expectations by making money during a global recession. With an assist from Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan, Navellier suggests Apple could actually grow revenues in fiscal 2020, despite the fact the world is being massively disrupted.

“Part of it is Apple’s diversified nature. While it made its bones on smartphones and computers, Apple has successfully grown its Services revenue in recent quarters to the point that it can help sustain the company even when a pandemic shuts down its factories and grinds supply lines to a halt,” Navellier wrote May 19.

The rise of services in the Apple ecosystem does not surprise me. Back in February 2017, I was extolling their virtues, suggesting that the gross margins of this segment of its business, given their recurring nature, would push its stock to $200.

At the time, it was trading around $129. It has more than doubled in the three years since.

McDonald’s (MCD)

I don’t know if this will surprise you, but of the 30 Dow Jones stocks, McDonald’s has the fifth-best cumulative return over the past five years at 87.2%. Microsoft takes top honors, up 291.9% over the same period.

On April 30, McDonald’s reported Q1 2020 earnings fell 17% to $1.47 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.57 a share. On the top line, its sales were $4.71 billion, $60 million higher than the consensus estimate, but 6% lower than a year earlier.

That’s about what you’d expect during a global pandemic and stay-at-home orders throughout most of the country. McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the company’s conference call that it doesn’t expect business to snap right back as its various markets reopen. It expects that its breakfast daypart, which has become an anchor of its business, has a big challenge ahead of it.

However, the familiarity of the Golden Arches will get it through its latest struggle.

McDonald’s has net debt of $46.9 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $5.3 billion and total debt is 103% of its assets. While that might appear high, it includes almost $13 billion in short-term and long-term operating lease liabilities (rent). It won’t have any trouble paying those.

Based on an enterprise value of $180.5 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 2.9%. While I wouldn’t classify MCD stock as cheap, over the long haul, it’s proven it can deliver the goods.

Coca-Cola (KO)

Year to date, Coca-Cola has a total return of -18.8%. Meanwhile, its biggest rival, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ), has a total return of -2.9%, significantly better. A big reason has to do with the fact Pepsi has a food business (Frito-Lay, Quaker Oats) that has been able to generate more business while everyone’s working from home, gorging on snacks and oatmeal.

However, if you’re interested in a fortress-like balance sheet to get you through this pandemic relatively intact, Coke is it.

Coca-Cola has net debt of $32.7 billion, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $8.3 billion and total debt is 54% of its assets. Based on an enterprise value of $224 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 3.7%.

Something interesting happened to Coca-Cola over the past five years.

While its sales fell 16% between 2015 and 2019, its net margins increased from 17% to almost 24%, a 700-basis-point increase. It did this by going to an asset-light business model, where others owned its bottling plants. In 2015, it made $7.4 billion on $44.3 billion in sales. Fast forward to 2019. It made $9.0 billion on $37.3 billion in sales. It made $1.6 billion more on $7 billion less in sales.

That’s quite a feat.

While the company continues to generate growth from the Coca-Cola brand, it is also making acquisitions to diversify its revenues, such as the 2019 purchase of Costa Coffee. The combination of smart growth with robust expense control will ensure KO stock rewards shareholders, like Warren Buffett, for years to come.

So far, nearly 100 Apple stores around the world have reopened with extensive changes, including temperature checks at the door, more frequent deep cleanings and requirements that staff and shoppers wear face coverings . Apple is also limiting the number of people allowed in stores and will begin curbside drop-off and pick-up options at some locations, according to a statement the company released Sunday.

Reopening an Apple store takes planning that depends on multiple factors, said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people.

""We look at every available piece of data — including local cases, near and long‑term trends, and guidance from national and local health officials,"" she wrote in the statement. ""These are not decisions we rush into — and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant.""

The White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, co-chaired by White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, called for “an unprecedented investment in digital infrastructure.” Members include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook, Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty.

The board “was focused on solving these challenges even prior to covid 19, but the pandemic has accelerated our need to take action,” said Barbara Humpton, CEO of Siemens USA.

The board’s efforts are aimed at helping connect displaced workers with pathways to upgrade their skills and learn new ones so they can move into “good jobs in rebounding fields as the health crisis abates and the economy begins to recover,” according to a White House official briefed on the plan.

The board wants governments “to streamline occupational licensing, education requirements, reduce the cost of licensing, and increase reciprocity” and urges the federal government to “allow student financial aid for high-quality, short-term, market-aligned credential programs.”

Workforce issues have taken on new importance as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the economy.

The United States lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.

In a statement, Ross said the advisory board’s meeting comes at a “challenging” time, but expressed confidence the president’s policies will lead to a rapid rebound.

Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find “solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.”

“By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,” IBM’s Rometty said in a statement.

Four major companies - Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Salesforce (CRM.N), IBM and Workday Inc (WDAY.O) - are announcing Tuesday they are creating “Interoperable Learning Records” to help workers and employers match applicants with jobs, the official said."

103,Warren Buffett Isn’t Buying Because You Soon May Need the Cash,https://investorplace.com/2020/05/warren-buffett-coronavirus-insurance-losses-berkshire/,2020-05-20 09:06:25-04:00,"There is a good reason why Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A , NYSE: BRK.B ) haven’t been “taking advantage” of the novel coronavirus.

Source: Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com

You may need the cash.

Insurance brokers at Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: WLTW ) have spun several scenarios for losses on insurance resulting from Covid-19. If the crisis is ending it could be a wash.

But if the virus returns in the fall, and this winds up like the 1918 flu, there could be $80 billion in losses. There’s even an “extreme” scenario with $140 billion in losses.

Most of Berkshire’s assets are held in insurance companies. Some you know, like GEICO. Most you don’t, like General Re, biBERK Business Insurance, Gateway Underwriters and National Indemnity. The parent company needs to backstop all of them. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire had $137 billion of cash at the end of March.

Warren Buffett Doesn’t See Any Bargains

There’s another reason why Warren Buffett isn’t tossing around cash right now.

The Federal Reserve has pumped so much new money into the economy that there are no bargains. A company that does work, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), sells for nearly 25 times earnings. Even companies that are temporarily out of business, like Carnival (NYSE: CCL ), are being snapped up.

The whole idea of value investing, which Buffett has practiced from the start of his career, is that you buy assets below their intrinsic value. With so much free money running around, such assets don’t exist.

The best values this year have been in government bonds. A three-month Treasury had an interest rate of 1.5% at the start of the year. Today it’s 0.1%. An older bond, with a real interest rate, thus has intrinsic value to the holder.

So-called “inflation-protected” securities now carry negative rates. There’s talk of more negative rates coming, government bonds paying less than their face value.

Will Insurance Cover the Coronavirus?

The biggest question in the insurance industry is whether business interruption insurance will cover Covid-19. Exclusions on many insurers’ standard forms don’t mention viruses at all.

Many of these questions will go to court. Some insurers will argue that the virus isn’t “physical damage.” The specific language of an insurance contract, which many business owners don’t clearly understand, will drive a process that has just begun. The legal process will continue long after the virus is gone.

The biggest potential losses in the Willis scenario involve the path the U.S. seems to be on, which it calls “limited success.” This assumes governments lift social distancing rules over economic losses and the virus spreads until controlled by “herd immunity.”

In this case, Willis projects $92 billion of losses in workers’ compensation, $27 billion in losses from economic liability claims, $22.7 billion from event cancellations and losses in other lines.

The Bottom Line

Warren Buffett is in the position J. P. Morgan was over a century ago. He’s the ultimate economic backstop. During the 2008 financial crisis, that meant opportunity. His willingness to backstop banks let the U.S. financial system heal and brought Berkshire Hathaway huge profits.

The current crisis is made for insurance. Berkshire Hathaway companies must shoulder the enormous losses caused by Covid-19. Otherwise the economy can’t recover.

Berkshire Hathaway seems capable of doing that. But that could nearly wipe out earnings in the near term. Some of the smaller companies Berkshire owns may also become victims of the virus.

Berkshire is being very conservative in the current crisis, in the best possible way. That’s good for all businesses. But in the near term it’s bad for Berkshire Hathaway.

Berkshire stock looks cheap now, but as the extent of the damage becomes clear it could fall well below intrinsic value.

Buy it then.

104,Paypal Finds Its Stride Thanks to the Coronavirus,https://investorplace.com/2020/05/paypal-stock-finds-its-stride-thanks-to-the-coronavirus/,2020-05-20 11:13:07-04:00,"Most stocks are struggling to claw their way back from the damage caused by the novel coronavirus. When investors panicked in March, the markets suffered record losses. Paypal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL ) stock was lumped in with the rest.

Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com

Paypal lost nearly a third of its value in four weeks, but that’s where the similarities end. Paypal didn’t just move toward recovery. Its stock exploded into growth territory.

At this point, PYPL has left its pre-crash levels in the dust.

Paypal stock is now up 39% in 2020. It has already matched its 2019 performance, a 31% gain, despite being less than halfway through the year and the chaos caused by the coronavirus.

Benefiting From the Coronavirus Pandemic

The key to the rapid recovery and growth in PYPL stock this year is directly related to the coronavirus pandemic. While most companies have seen their business take a big hit during the lockdown, very few have actually benefited.

The example most people think of is Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ). With employees increasingly working from home, the popularity of video conferencing software went through the roof. Zoom was easy to use and offered a fee tier. It became the go-to solution.

Zoom stumbled a few times because of security concerns, but Zoom stock — which ended 2019 just about where it started after its IPO earlier that year — posted triple-digit growth so far in 2020.

Paypal is in a similar situation, in that the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown happen to play into its business model. Online shopping. Contactless payment. Transferring money electronically to friends and family in order to avoid touching cash.

This is exactly what Paypal and its Venmo mobile payment solution are designed for. The Internal Revenue Service even allowed recipients to receive their $1,200 stimulus check through a mobile payment app, including Venmo.

Paypal CEO Daniel Schulman told Fortune that not only had his company seen a “tremendous surge,” in business, but he saw it as something that will outlast the pandemic. “We’re not going to go backwards to what was. We’re not going to be using cash nearly as much,” said Shulman.

Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff agrees. He told Politico the crisis is “absolutely going to drive people to prefer credit and debit to cash.”

It’s Not Just Paypal

Of course, Paypal isn’t the only company that’s benefiting from the rapid shift to online shopping and contactless payment. At the end of April, Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ) reported a 40% increase in contactless payments. In April, Bloomberg reported that use of contactless payment systems including Apple’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Apple Pay were skyrocketing.

What About a Recession?

The downside in being a company like Paypal is the potential hit to your business when the economy swings into a recession. With job losses not seen in generations, a recession is a virtual guarantee at this point. Depending on how deep the coronavirus damage is to the economy, odds are we’ll be facing a full-blown depression.

In both cases, consumers are likely to tighten their spending. And that will have a negative impact on Paypal. The questions are how bad will it be, and how long will it last?

The Bottom Line on Paypal Stock

There are few companies as well positioned as Paypal to benefit from the coronavirus pandemic’s upending of consumer shopping behavior. Paypal is an established payment option for many e-commerce websites. It can be used for contactless payment in many retail locations and is accepted by many popular food delivery services. Paypal’s Venmo is popular for transferring cash, and its digital wallet can even be used to receive a stimulus payment.

The “tremendous surge” in Paypal use has resulted in big gains for PYPL stock. The prospect of consumer spending slowing down is a risk worth noting, but it’s not spooking investment analysts. Of the 41 surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, Paypal is a consensus buy with 32 rating the stock a “buy” and three rating it “overweight.”

The U.S. has seen a significant slowing of the virus spread in most states, and previous major hotspots are showing consistent day-over-day declines — including New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced more measures designed to ease the restrictions imposed on the U.S.’s hottest COVID-19 zone. Antibody testing data showed that the Big Apple had a positive rate of nearly 20%.

Nevertheless, the global case count is creeping toward 5 million, with more than 320,000 dead. In the U.S. more than 1.5 million are infected and more than 93,000 have died.

Amid a politically charged war of words with the United States, the World Health Organization warned that President Donald Trump’s threat to yank funding over complaints that the organization was too close to China would damage the agency’s efforts to help the poor.

Meanwhile, some large employers, like tech giants and financial services firms, are maintaining work-from-home policies until the end of 2020.

Meanwhile, others are focused on return to work strategies and the elements needed to do so, like questionnaires, temperature scans and on-site testing. The Labor Department plans to expand inspection criteria to include coronavirus-related hazards, as some employees begin heading back to the office.

Schools are also faced with the same dilemma of reopening, with uneven results. In the U.S., California’s public universities have chosen to stay remote for the upcoming school year. In the U.K., meanwhile, Cambridge University has become the first to announce remote schooling for 2020-2021.

Curbing Moderna’s enthusiasm

Moderna (MRNA) has been under the spotlight this week, after announcing its experimental vaccine had produced positive results in a Phase 1 trial. The market has been largely underpinned by the results, but investors took a breather after a STAT report highlighted reasons to be cautious, as some health experts have articulated.

The actual data has not yet been released — which according to Criag Garthwaite, director of the program on healthcare at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, is the crux of the problem.

“It was a discussion of [just] a portion of a set of Phase 1 clinical trial results,” Garthwaite said.

However, Moderna’s CEO Stephane Bancel told Fox Business in an interview that the company was clear the information was “interim data.”

The scrutiny surrounding Moderna mirrored that on Gilead Sciences (GILD), when it released its company and National Institute of Health sponsored clinical trial results for an antiviral treatment. Gilead’s stock swung wildly in the days following its data release.

Yet health experts say there is still some reasons to be optimistic about Moderna’s treatment, given that the virus has shown to be impacted, even if minimally, in both rodent and animal trials. Trial information released later down the road will be more informative, and can provide greater certainty about the vaccine.

Testing ramps up

Among public health officials, contact testing is a hot-button issue in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, and the move to reopen states. As a result, approximately 23 countries are seeking access to new technology from Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOG), which uses mobile apps to log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes."

This Book Changed Warren Buffett's Life

Welcome to Episode #191 of the Value Investor Podcast.

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

At the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May 2020, Warren Buffett again discussed his investing mentor, Benjamin Graham, describing him as one of the smartest people he’s ever met.

He also said that Graham’s Book, The Intelligent Investor, changed his life.

First published in 1949, The Intelligent Investor was the first investing book to be written for Mom and Pop investors.

Tracey has covered several different chapters of the 600 page book on previous podcasts.

But this week, given the volatility in the stock markets thanks to the coronavirus crisis, she tackled the final chapter, Chapter 20, appropriately titled: “Margin of Safety as the Central Concept of Investment”.

How Can You Find Margin of Safety Stocks?

Graham discusses investing in companies that have paid dividends over a number of years and in abnormal market conditions, such as a recession.

As we have seen this year, many companies have suspended their dividend due to the uncertainty around COVID-19.

But what about those companies that are still paying it?

And what if they also were Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), which hopefully means rising earnings estimates?

5 Margin of Safety Stocks

1. AbbVie (ABBV) just closed on its big acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) drug maker is paying a dividend yielding 5.2%. It’s also dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8.5.

2. B&G Foods (BGS) is having its day in the sun as Americans are buying packaged foods in droves thanks to the coronavirus shutdowns. It has 50 brands in its arsenal including Green Giant, Spice Islands and Cream of Wheat. It recently announced its dividend, the 63rd consecutive payment to shareholders. It’s currently yielding 8.2%.

3. H&R Block, Inc. (HRB) is apparently still paying the dividend which is yielding 6.3%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is the cheapest stock here, with a forward P/E of just 5.3.

4. Microsoft (MSFT) has been paying a dividend for over a decade and with its cash hoard, is unlikely to suspend it during the crisis. But shareholders are only getting a yield of 1.1% and investors will have to pay 32x forward earnings to own it.

5. Apple (AAPL) also has a big cash hoard, so it too should easily be able to pay its dividend during 2020. But it’s yielding even less, at just 1%, as the tech giant’s forward P/E has risen to its highest in over a decade, at 25.

What else should you know about Benjamin Graham and the book that changed Warren Buffett’s life?

This Book Changed Warren Buffett's Life

Welcome to Episode #191 of the Value Investor Podcast.

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

At the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May 2020, Warren Buffett again discussed his investing mentor, Benjamin Graham, describing him as one of the smartest people he’s ever met.

He also said that Graham’s Book, The Intelligent Investor, changed his life.

First published in 1949, The Intelligent Investor was the first investing book to be written for Mom and Pop investors.

Tracey has covered several different chapters of the 600 page book on previous podcasts.

But this week, given the volatility in the stock markets thanks to the coronavirus crisis, she tackled the final chapter, Chapter 20, appropriately titled: “Margin of Safety as the Central Concept of Investment”.

How Can You Find Margin of Safety Stocks?

Graham discusses investing in companies that have paid dividends over a number of years and in abnormal market conditions, such as a recession.

As we have seen this year, many companies have suspended their dividend due to the uncertainty around COVID-19.

But what about those companies that are still paying it?

And what if they also were Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), which hopefully means rising earnings estimates?

5 Margin of Safety Stocks

1. AbbVie (ABBV) just closed on its big acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) drug maker is paying a dividend yielding 5.2%. It’s also dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8.5.

2. B&G Foods (BGS) is having its day in the sun as Americans are buying packaged foods in droves thanks to the coronavirus shutdowns. It has 50 brands in its arsenal including Green Giant, Spice Islands and Cream of Wheat. It recently announced its dividend, the 63rd consecutive payment to shareholders. It’s currently yielding 8.2%.

3. H&R Block, Inc. (HRB) is apparently still paying the dividend which is yielding 6.3%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is the cheapest stock here, with a forward P/E of just 5.3.

4. Microsoft (MSFT) has been paying a dividend for over a decade and with its cash hoard, is unlikely to suspend it during the crisis. But shareholders are only getting a yield of 1.1% and investors will have to pay 32x forward earnings to own it.

5. Apple (AAPL) also has a big cash hoard, so it too should easily be able to pay its dividend during 2020. But it’s yielding even less, at just 1%, as the tech giant’s forward P/E has risen to its highest in over a decade, at 25.

108,Apple (AAPL) to Beef Up TV+ Content Library With Popular Shows,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-beef-tv-content-144002545.html,2020-05-22 14:40:02+00:00,"Apple AAPL is looking to strengthen its content library with some older films and television series.



The tech giant has only released Apple original TV shows and movies since its launch. However, off-late the streaming service has been in talks with Hollywood executives about licensing older content, per a Bloomberg report.



Apple TV+, which costs only $4.99 per month with the sole target of streaming original series, movies, and documentaries, currently offers just 30 original shows and movies. However, it provides app users access to HBO, Showtime and other services for broader content variety.



However, the spread of coronavirus has shut down film and television production since mid-March. This will likely cause delays in Apple TV+ originals set to come out later this year and early 2021.



With fewer new originals in the pipeline and free trials starting to expire, the need for additional content is even more acute.



Apple Inc. Price and Consensus

Rivals Gain on Backlog Content



Apple TV+’s direct competitors have found a lot of success in balancing the scales between developing original content and providing their audience with a backlog of licensed content.



Lacking the kind of back catalog that Walt Disney DIS and Warner own and that Amazon AMZN and Netflix NFLX first acquired and then built, Apple’s limited original content library and a low cost of entry strategy have struggled to attract subscribers.



As of the end of February, Apple TV+ had 10 million users but the majority of those subscribers aren't paying for the service, which offered a free, year-long subscription for users who signed up immediately after its launch.



Netflix, by contrast, has more than 183 million subscribers while Disney+ had 10 million sign-ups for Disney+ on launch day (including presales and free trials), and reported 54.5 million subscribers as of the beginning of May.



Among popular content on Netflix in terms of time spent watching is old licensed series. As many media companies move to take back the streaming licenses on their most popular old shows, companies like Netflix are forced to pay extremely high prices for the few popular shows left available to license.



Shows like The Office and Friends, the latter of which is moving to HBO Max, became premier titles for Netflix while it bought the rights to Seinfeld for over $500 million.



Apple’s Efforts to Beat Competition



While acquiring the license to TV shows and movies should help bolster Apple TV+’s catalogue, it is also expected to be expensive.



Nonetheless, continued momentum in service offerings amid coronavirus-led lockdown is expected to aid Apple in the near term, Notably, Services (22.9% of sales) revenues grew 16.6% from the year-ago quarter to $13.35 billion, a record in the company’s history.



Apple is taking various other measures to improve subscriber growth on its Tv+ platform. From mid-April 2020, the company made a number of Apple TV+ shows free to watch, including popular shows such as Little America, Servant, For All Mankind and Dickinson.



Additionally, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has begun acquiring two types of original podcasts — one category is audio spinoffs of existing movies and programs on Apple TV+ service, and the other is original programs that could eventually be adapted into future TV+ video content. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.



Apple has asked some producers working on podcasts to provide versions of their offerings without advertisements, which fit into TV+’s ad-free approach.



Moreover, Apple TV+ will launch Greyhound, a World War II drama starring and written by Tom Hanks and produced by Sony Pictures. The film had originally been targeted for a theatrical release on Father’s Day weekend. Apple paid $70 million for the Sony Pictures movie.

109,Top 1st-Quarter Buys of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-1st-quarter-buys-bill-222111986.html,2020-05-22 22:21:11+00:00,"The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust recently disclosed its portfolio updates for the first quarter of 2020, which ended on March 31.

Established in 2000 by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder Bill Gates (Trades, Portfolio) and his wife Melinda, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the world with over $40 billion in total assets. Six years after it was established, the group's trustees created a two-entity structure: the Foundation, which distributes money to grantees, and the Foundation Trust, which manages the group's endowment. The investments of the Foundation Trust are managed by an outside team of portfolio managers. Out of the three trustees, the Gates provide guidelines for the portfolio managers, such as defining areas in which the foundation will not invest due to philanthropic reasons (such as tobacco stocks), while Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) does not play a role in the group's investment decisions. The goal of the foundation is to distribute donations and income from investments in the form of grants to encourage and fund philanthropic business activity.





During the quarter, the trust reduced its stake in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) and established new holdings in Schrodinger Inc. (NASDAQ:SDGR), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter Inc. (NYSE:TWTR).

Berkshire Hathaway

The trust cut its holding in Berkshire Hathaway by 5,000,000 Class B shares, or 10.02%, impacting the equity portfolio by -5.30%. During the quarter, shares traded for an average price of $213.25.

Buffett's Omaha-based conglomerate consists of a wide variety of companies, including Geico, BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, See's Candies and many more. Buffett is perhaps more famous for his investing skills, which enabled him to convert an obsolete textile company into a successful multi-faceted business via acquisitions. In 2006, Buffett pledged most of his fortune to the Gates Foundation and four of his family's own charitable trusts.

On May 22, Berkshire's Class B stock traded around $174.14 for a market cap of $423.21 billion. The share price is down 23% since U.S. markets peaked at the end of February.

GuruFocus gives the company a financial strength rating of 4 out of 10, a profitability rating of 7 out of 10 and a business predictability rating of three out of five stars. However, due to specific changes in U.S. accounting rules that became effective in 2018, in which companies must report unrealized investment gains or losses as part of their income, it can be hard to get a visual on a valuation for the conglomerate. Buffett wrote about this topic in his 2019 annual letter to shareholders:



""The adoption of the rule by the accounting profession, in fact, was a monumental shift in its own thinking. Before 2018, GAAP insisted - with an exception for companies whose business was to trade securities - that unrealized gains within a portfolio of stocks were never to be included in earnings and unrealized losses were to be included only if they were deemed ""other than temporary."" Now, Berkshire must enshrine in each quarter's bottom line - a key item of news for many investors, analysts and commentators - every up and down movement of the stocks it owns, however capricious those fluctuations may be. Berkshire's 2018 and 2019 years glaringly illustrate the argument we have with the new rule. In 2018, a down year for the stock market, our net unrealized gains decreased by $20.6 billion, and we therefore reported GAAP earnings of only $4 billion. In 2019, rising stock prices increased net unrealized gains by the aforementioned $53.7 billion, pushing GAAP earnings to the $81.4 billion reported at the beginning of this letter. Those market gyrations led to a crazy 1,900% increase in GAAP earnings!""

110,"Spotify, Amazon, Apple, and Barstool Sports are all betting big on podcasts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spotify-amazon-apple-and-barstool-sports-are-all-betting-big-on-podcasts-001349735.html,2020-05-25 00:13:49+00:00,"If there was any remaining doubt that Spotify (SPOT) is extremely serious about podcasts, last week the Swedish streaming company that already spent more than half a billion dollars in the past two years to acquire Gimlet Media, Anchor, Parcast, and The Ringer added an exclusive deal with Joe Rogan reportedly worth $100 million. Rogan’s entire library of “The Joe Rogan Experience,” one of the top podcasts in America, will become exclusive to Spotify and its 286 million users before the end of 2020, along with all new episodes, plus the videos of his podcasts.

Rogan, in his third or fourth career act (TV actor on shows like “News Radio”; host of the competition show “Fear Factor”; UFC commentator), has become a mega-influencer and newsmaker. (Recall when Elon Musk smoked weed on Rogan’s podcast in 2018.)

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is beefing up its podcast plan, seeking to acquire podcast spinoffs of Apple TV+ shows and podcasts that could become Apple TV+ shows, according to Bloomberg. And of course Amazon (AMZN) wants to be in the mix: Amazon-owned Audible is on the prowl to buy podcasts, and is offering more money to acquire them than everyone else except for Spotify.

So what are all these tech giants telling us about a business that somehow feels both still nascent and already overcrowded?

According to Edison Research’s 2020 Infinite Dial report, 37% of the U.S. population now listens to a podcast at least once a month, or 104 million people. That’s a large number, though not enormous, and the number of weekly podcast listeners is far lower: 68 million. Although the biggest podcasts have laundry lists of brand sponsors (Rogan’s include 23andme, Blue Apron, Square’s Cash App, Casper, Dollar Shave Club, Postmates and Quibi), the industry still generates less than $1 billion in ad sales per year.

But look at the growth rate. The number of monthly podcast listeners jumped 16% in the last year. And the number has more than doubled since 2015. Meanwhile, weekly listeners are extremely engaged: the average weekly listener listens to six podcasts per week. And the demographics are squarely in the sweet spot advertisers want: half of monthly podcast listeners are between ages 12 and 34.

‘The best content rises to the top’

Edison’s report also notes that 169 million Americans listen to some form of “online audio” each week, a much larger number than the weekly or monthly podcast listeners, and podcast bulls are banking that many of those “online audio” listeners (think music streaming, music videos on YouTube, or streaming radio) will become podcast listeners.

Michael Bosstick, CEO of the podcast network Dear Media, says podcasting isn’t overcrowded yet. “That’s been said about every content medium, it’s been said about blogs, it’s been said about social creators,” Bosstick told Yahoo Finance Live. “I think the best content rises to the top. And I think we’re just starting to scratch the surface of people taking this medium very seriously. For how old the medium is, to see the attention it’s finally getting, I think we’re just starting to scratch the surface of people jumping in.”

Digital media companies have understood podcasts for a few years, and now the tech giants are getting in late, but bringing big dollars to buy instant footholds.

Barstool Sports started as a Boston sports blog in 2003, but has become known for its podcasts, which now make up well over a third of Barstool’s revenue. The company has more than 30 podcasts and is a top 10 U.S. podcast publisher, with more monthly podcast listeners than ESPN. A handful of its newest podcasts are hosted by women, like “Chicks in the Office” and “Schnitt Talk,” and one of them, “Call Her Daddy,” is currently the No. 1 podcast in the U.S., a major shift for a company once derided as a dude blog."
111,Sony to take full control of listed financial arm for $3.7 billion,https://ca.investing.com/news/technology-news/sony-to-turn-financial-arm-into-wholly-owned-unit-for-37-billion-nikkei-2147982,None,"© Reuters. The Sony logo is seen on a building in the Manhattan borough of New York City

By Makiko Yamazaki

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sony Corp (T: ) said on Tuesday it will turn its listed financial arm, Sony Financial Holdings Inc (T: ), into a wholly owned unit through a tender offer worth about 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion).

The deal will allow the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant to strengthen its presence in the fintech field to compete with global tech majors such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N: ) and Apple Inc (O: ).

It also reflects Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's strategy of making revenue streams more stable following a major revamp by his predecessor which shifted Sony's focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to entertainment content and subscription-based businesses.

The deal is the biggest strategic move for Sony under Yoshida since a $2.3 billion acquisition of EMI Music Publishing, announced soon after Yoshida took the helm in 2018.

""The financial business has a stable profit base in Japan,"" Yoshida told reporters and analysts in a briefing. Taking full control of the business ""will help us hedge growing geopolitical risks.""

Sony, which will change its name to Sony Group next year, already owns 65% of Sony Financial. It offers about 2,600 yen for each remaining Sony Financial share - a premium of about 26% over Monday's closing price of 2,064 yen. The tender offer closes in July.

Sony Financial, a consistently stable revenue source for Sony, has banking, life and non-life insurance, credit card and nursing care businesses in Japan with about 11,000 staff. Total assets stood at 14.5 trillion yen as of the end of last year.

It contributed operating profit of 129.6 billion yen in the year ended in March, or about 15% of the group.

Sony expects the acquisition to have a positive tax-related impact of 40 billion to 50 billion yen annually on net profit.

The plan, first reported by the business daily earlier on Tuesday, sent shares of Sony Financial up nearly 17% to 2,412 yen before trading of the stock was suspended. Sony Corp shares rose 3.3% in a broader market that ended up 1.5%."

The popular podcaster sold his 11-year-old “The Joe Rogan Experience” series to Spotify SPOT, -1.33% in a licensing deal that’s reportedly worth more than $100 million, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Rogan’s full library — which adds up to almost 1,500 episodes, which weren’t available on the streaming service before — will hit Spotify beginning Sept. 1. Episodes of the video podcast are currently available on YouTube, but will move off the Alphabet GOOG, +0.54% platform to be exclusive to Spotify by the end of the year.

Rogan, 52, told his millions of fans via Instagram FB, +1.52% on Thursday that “it will be the exact same show” that they’ve come to love, emphasizing that, “I am not going to be an employee of Spotify,” and he’ll be working with the same production crew.

“The only difference will be, it will now be available on the largest audio platform in the world,” he added. “It will be free to you; you will just have to go to Spotify to get it.”

But for those who aren’t among the reported 190 million people who download “The Joe Rogan Experience” each month, here are five things to know about the stand-up comic and former Ultimate Fighting Championship interviewer who’s become Forbes’ top-earning podcaster.

You might recognize him from TV. Before launching “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast in 2009, Rogan appeared on Fox’s “Hardball” as a star basketball player, and on NBC’s “NewsRadio” as a handyman and conspiracy theorist. He was also the host of “Fear Factor” from 2001 to 2006, and he’s done stand-up specials for Netflix NFLX, -1.58% and Comedy Central. He cut his interviewing chops doing color commentary for the UFC, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards.

He’s also married to model-turned-producer Jessica Ditzel, and they have three daughters.

He was already making $30 million a year before joining Spotify. Rogan topped Forbes’ inaugural highest-earning podcaster list earlier this year, pulling in a reported $30 million and running the No. 1 podcast in the world, according to Apple AAPL, +0.64% . “He’s delivering scale and engagement,” Tom Webster, senior vice president at Edison Research, told Forbes. “He’s the No. 1 in terms of reach in the U.S.”

He’s praised Bernie Sanders, but will probably vote for Trump. While Rogan has expressed some liberal views, such as supporting the legalization of marijuana, he recently revealed that he will probably vote for Trump this November because he just “can’t vote” for presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden. “I’d rather vote for Trump than [Biden]. I don’t think he can handle anything. You’re relying entirely on his cabinet,” he said. “If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can’t do that. And we don’t know what the f— he’ll be like after a year in office.”

Read more:Joe Rogan on why he’d vote for Donald Trump: Democrats have ‘made us all morons’ by running Joe Biden

Yet in January, he suggested that he would vote for Bernie Sanders, largely because the liberal Vermont Senator has been “insanely consistent his entire life.” The Sanders campaign was quick to tweet out this unofficial endorsement its official Twitter TWTR, +0.86% feed at the time.

He appeared to smoke pot with Elon Musk on the air. One of Rogan’s most notorious interviews came in September 2018, when Tesla TSLA, -1.29% CEO Elon Musk sat down and appeared to smoke weed with him on the air. (It should be noted they were filming in California, where recreational marijuana is legal.) Watch the video below; the smoking begins about 2 hours and 10 minutes in.

He’s drawn backlash for giving Alex Jones a platform, and making offensive remarks. Rogan has been a controversial figure, in part for his interviews with the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and axed Google engineer James Damore. Perhaps even more notorious than his Musk Q&A, however, were his two marathon interviews with InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Jones, who has said the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children was a hoax. The second Jones interview was a five-hour marathon that saw him claim that the U.S. government was making intergalactic deals with aliens by using psychedelic drugs.

Rogan has also made plenty of his own controversial remarks on his show and in his stand-up that have been called racist, sexist and transphobic by critics. They include comparing a black neighborhood to “Planet of the Apes,” and saying that mixed martial artist Fallon Fox, who is a transgender woman, is “a f---ing man.” He has said such remarks were taken out of context."
113,Why Sony Sold Streaming Rights For Tom Hanks Movie To Apple Instead Of Waiting Out The Pandemic,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-sony-sold-streaming-rights-094234949.html,2020-05-20 09:42:34+00:00,"Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE) has sold the streaming rights for its upcoming movie ""Greyhound"" to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), CNBC reported on Tuesday.

The movie, starring Tom Hanks, was supposed to be released during the Father's Day weekend on June 19 before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic delayed the theater launch of all productions.

Greyhound will now be released directly on Apple TV+ following Sony's 15-year streaming rights deal with Apple, CNBC noted.

Sony's decision is in contrast with a majority of other producers who have simply chosen to delay the launch of their major films.

People familiar with the matter told CNBC that the Japanese conglomerate was worried ""that the film wouldn't be able to find a slot among the superhero films and franchises that had been delayed from the summer.""

Apple has shelled $70 million for the deal, according to CNBC. Sony was also in talks with Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), the sources told CNBC, but wasn't willing to pay as much as the Cupertino-based consumer electronics giant.

Price Action

Sony's shares closed 1.6% lower at $63.05 on Tuesday and traded another 0.3% lower at $62.88 in the after-hours session.

Apple shares closed 0.6% lower at $313.14 in the regular session the same day but added 0.5% in the after-hours at $314.54.

114,Xiaomi gets first-quarter sales boost as smartphone demand rebounds,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/chinese-smartphone-maker-xiaomi-reports-136-rise-in-firstquarter--revenue-2177815,None,"© Reuters. FILE PHOTO: People walk past a Xiaomi store in Shenyang

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Xiaomi (OTC: ) Corp reported a 13.6% rise in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, beating estimates, as the Chinese smartphone maker sold more phones and benefited from sales of its higher-priced 5G models.

The company managed to boost sales despite the impact of the coronavirus, which rattled supply chains and dampened overall smartphone demand.

""Our production in mainland China has largely resumed, and smartphone demand has rebounded quickly,"" the company said in its first-quarter earnings release.

Xiaomi's optimism stands in contrast to rivals Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (OTC: ) Co Ltd, which have both warned of a tough year ahead.

Sales in the first quarter of 2020 rose to 49.7 billion yuan ($7.00 billion) from 43.76 billion yuan in the same period prior year, beating analyst expectations of 47.86 billion yuan.

The company attributed the jump to rising prices for its just-released 5G phones in China, as well as growing sales overseas.

Profits fell by roughly one third due to a drop in the value of Xiaomi's investments in other companies.

The company gets most of its revenue from selling mobile handsets, but also makes money by selling online ads and other types of consumer hardware.

Xiaomi has faced intense competition in China over the past few years from bigger domestic rival Huawei. Also, the domestic smartphone market in China has been shrinking and to offset this Xiaomi and other smaller Chinese rivals have focused on overseas growth.

Xiaomi's shipments to Chinese consumers in the first quarter fell by more than a quarter from a year earlier, market research firm Canalys said, compared with an 18% drop in smartphone sales in the country.

In March, the company said it was seeing signs of a sales recovery in China after weeks of lockdown to stem the coronavirus outbreak."
115,Facebook Stock Breaks Out to All-Time High,https://www.investopedia.com/facebook-stock-breaks-out-to-all-time-high-4845727,2020-05-22 13:37:09.592000+00:00,"Facebook, Inc. (FB) joined FAANG members Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) at new highs on Wednesday after completing a three-month, 87-point round trip triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Accumulation readings surged to new highs as well, highlighting the rekindling of investor interest in big tech stocks while adding fuel to hopes that the broader market bottomed out in March.

The social media giant gapped up above the January high at $224 on the fifth day of a rally underpinned by the introduction of Facebook Shops and Instagram Shop, two marketing services designed to help small businesses go online. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index also looks set to challenge the first quarter high, carving another notch in a powerful recovery wave that has booked 40% upside since mid-March.

Dow component Apple Inc. (AAPL) is now trading just 10 points under the 2020 high, while Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is bringing up the rear in the FAANG quintet, stuck more than 7% under its February peak at $1,530. Alphabet stock is more vulnerable than its rivals to economic ups and downs due to the company's reliance on advertising revenue. Even so, investors have been scooping up shares of Google's parent company, lifting accumulation readings to new highs.

FB Long-Term Chart (2012 – 2020)

TradingView.com

Facebook came public to great fanfare in May 2012, opening at $42.50 and topping out at $45 a few minutes later. The subsequent downturn posted an all-time low at $17.55 in September, giving way to an uptick that reached the prior high in September 2013. An immediate breakout attracted a large population of momentum buyers, lifting above $70 in the first quarter of 2014. Price action then eased into a rising channel, with institutional buyers taking control in a historic advance that finally ended at $219 in July 2018.

Privacy concerns then took control of the tape, triggering a 42-point sell gap and decline that broke the rising channel, relinquishing another 52 points before bottoming out at a two-year low in December. The bounce into 2019 reversed after entering the gap in July, yielding a steady pullback into October, followed by a rally that completed a 100% retracement into the 2018 high in January 2020. The subsequent breakout failed three weeks later, reinforcing resistance at $219.

Price action carved a lower high in February, followed by a vertical decline that shaved nearly 40% off the stock's value into the March low at $137.10. The bounce into May unfolded at the same trajectory as the prior downtick, carving a V-shaped pattern that reached the January high on Tuesday, ahead of Wednesday's high-volume breakout. The stock is adding to those gains in Thursday's pre-market, despite a modest decline in major benchmarks.

The monthly stochastic oscillator crossed into a buy cycle near the panel's midpoint a few weeks ago and has maintained that bullish signal, but whipsaws are still possible in coming weeks. In addition, straight-up price action since March has left behind few strong support levels, raising the odds for a correction that shakes out weak hands. In turn, investors can't rule out a pullback that reaches the $190 to $200 price zone before attracting strong buying interest.

FB Short-Term Chart (2018 – 2020)

TradingView.com

The on-balance volume (OBV) accumulation-distribution indicator posted a new high in July 2018 and rolled into a distribution phase that settled at a 16-month low in November. Subsequent accumulation reached resistance this week and broke out with price, setting the stage for an uptrend that could eventually reach $300. However, a sell-off to the narrowly aligned 50- and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) near $190 could unfold at any time, especially if the broad market loses ground.

The Bottom Line

Facebook stock broke out above 2018 resistance on Wednesday, joining FAANG members Netflix and Amazon at all-time highs."
116,7 Top-Rated Biotech Stocks to Buy on the Hunt for a Vaccine,https://investorplace.com/2020/05/7-top-rated-biotech-stocks-to-buy/,2020-05-07 00:00:00,"The novel coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on markets, and just when stocks are into recovery mode, we have the specter of a recession to reckon with. If not an outright depression. That’s going to cause challenges for many sectors. However, if there’s a bright spot in all this, it’s biotech stocks.

With the scramble for viral and antibody testing kits, and the ultimate goal of finding a vaccine for Covid-19, many biotech companies are suddenly in the spotlight. Even those that aren’t directly working on a Covid-related solution look more attractive. Besides the entire industry getting more attention than usual, investors know they’re less at risk of a consumer spending crunch that could hit tech companies like Apple ( NASDAQ: AAPL ).

With that lead-up, here are seven biotech stocks that are positioned to pay off nicely.

Co-Diagnostics (NASDAQ: CODX

(NASDAQ: iBioPharma (NYSE: IBIO

(NYSE: Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA

(NASDAQ: Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB

(NASDAQ: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GLID

(NASDAQ: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX

(NASDAQ: Inovio (NASDAQ: INO

Some have seen their share price explode this year based on their Covid-19 involvement. Even so, that would just be the start should their research pay off.

Biotech Stocks to Buy: Co-Diagnostics (CODX)

Source: Shutterstock

You may have read my recent overview of Co-Diagnostics. This Utah-based biotech company has posted amazing growth in 2020 on the strength of its Logix Smart Covid-19 test kit.

Doctors quickly learned that symptoms aren’t a reliable way to determine if someone is infected with Covid-19. Accurate and fast testing for Covid-19 infections is critical to determining whether someone needs to be isolated and/or hospitalized for treatment. As the country begins to re-open, testing becomes even more critical as medical authorities monitor for potential second waves of the pandemic.

Looking into the future, testing is still going to be important for years — even if a vaccine is developed.

Co-Diagnostics is one of the leading providers of Covid-19 test kits, and it’s selling them to states faster than it can make them. That’s over 6 million to date, with production going full blast to manufacture another 20 million tests just to keep up with current and short-term demand.

CODX stock is up over 1,900% to this point in 2020, with no signs of running out of steam.

iBioPharma (IBIO)

IBIO is one of the companies on the cutting edge of Covid-19 vaccine research. On March 26, the company announced its IBIO-200 vaccine candidate was being fast-tracked to pre-clinical immunization studies at Texas A&M University System’s (“TAMUS”) laboratories.

On April 27, the company announced the impressive scale of its manufacturing capability, should its vaccine prove to be effective:

“If our own proprietary SARS-CoV-2 Virus-Like Particle (“VLP”) program, IBIO-200, results in an approved vaccine, we estimate that we could make about 500 million doses of high-quality product annually at our Texas facility, depending upon the potency we see in the clinic.”

IBIO shares are up over 1,200% so far in 2020, but that would be a drop in the bucket should its IBIO-200 vaccine succeed.

Moderna (MRNA)

Moderna is another play on the race for a Covid-19 vaccine. The American biotech company has been focused on mRNA therapy — modifying the body’s RNA to treat conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious diseases.

That is exciting in itself, but it’s the infectious diseases angle that has investors watching closely. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 is a candidate as a Covid-19 vaccine, and it has potential. On May 18, the company announced positive results for Phase 1 testing of the vaccine, led by the National Institute of Health. These trials showed the subjects had antibody levels at or above levels measured in recovered Covid-19 patients, without showing serious side effects.

That news caused MRNA to rocket 29% in a single day of trading, and it’s now up 279% so far in 2020.

BioGen (BIIB)

BioGen is a biotech company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. You may recall the name from 2019. BIIB stock tanked in March 2019, falling 29% in its worst day of trading ever, after news broke that it was ending trials for a blockbuster Alzheimer’s drug called Aducanumab.

Fast forward a year, and BioGen is in the hunt for a Covid-19 treatment, in partnership with Vir Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ: VIR ). In March, it was announced the two companies are working on developing antibodies as potential treatments for Covid-19.

BIIB stock has been on a roller coaster this year — although it has still managed to post modest 5% growth — but there are two prizes in play. First, that Vir partnership could pay off. And second, Aducanumab (the Alzheimer’s drug) is back in play. The company announced new phase 3 clinical trials in January. Those were subsequently pushed to the third quarter (news that the market didn’t take kindly to), but the new clinical trials raise hope that the company has a winner in Aducanumab.

With nearly 50 million people currently suffering from Alzheimers worldwide, the potential payoff for Aducanumab is massive.

Gilead Sciences (GLID)

Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com

Regular readers know that Gilead Sciences is considered a strong buy right now. This biotech company was the first to get government approval for a coronavirus treatment.

On May 1, FDA-approval was issued for use of Gilead’s remdesivir drug for treatment of Covid-19. Remdesivir may not be a miracle cure, but clinical trials show it has reduced the recovery time required for some patients. With many hospitals facing bed shortages, anything that reduces the time Covid-19 patients spend there is a big win, and Gilead has donated 1.5 million vials of the drug.

The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) — a pharma industry watchdog — recently assessed the fair sticker price for remdesivir therapy at up to to $4,460 per patient. That has real potential upside for GLID stock. If the success continues and remdesivir becomes a go-treatment for Covid-19, Piper Sandler analysts project it could generate up to $2 billion in revenue for Gilead in 2020 alone — even after giving away those 1.5 million doses.

At this point, GLID stock has posted 13% growth so far in 2020, even though it is down significantly from its $84 close (a two-year high) on April 30.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX)

Boston-based Vertex has posted 30% growth so far in 2020. This biopharmaceutical company isn’t focused on Covid-19 research. So why is VRTX seeing a growth spurt?

It isn’t. Unlike many of the biotech and pharmaceutical companies that are suddenly seeing big gains in anticipation of a payoff from coronavirus-related projects, Vertex has been on a steady growth path since 2017, and especially since the fall of 2019. That’s continuing into 2020.

The company sells three different drugs for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, and all but owns that market. The latest treatment from Vertex — Trikafta — was approved by the FDA last October, and is applicable to 90% of global CF patients. Thus the accelerated pace of growth for VRTX stock starting last October.

With revenue up 77% in the first quarter, Vertex upped its full-year-revenue projections, when so many other companies have been busy slashing them.

Inovio (INO)

Finally, Inovio, another biotech company that’s gotten the nod here before.

This is a company with a proven record of quickly bringing effective solutions to market for vexing diseases. This includes having a treatment to clinic for Ebola in 15 months, nine months for MERS and, six and a half months for Zika.

Is Inovio on the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine? You bet! The company currently has 40 humans enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial, with preliminary data expected to be seen in June. Those trials have big backers, by the way, with both the Department of Defense and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ponying up millions to accelerate testing.

INO stock has performed very well in 2020, posting gains over 390%.

117,Forget Netflix. Here’s the ESG Thesis for Disney.,https://www.barrons.com/articles/forget-netflix-heres-the-esg-thesis-for-disney-51590150600,None,"Text size

For Walt Disney investors agog at Netflix’s meteoric rise to a $200 billion market value, take heart from Disney’s superior sustainability metrics, which should help lift the theme-park giant’s shares, says Confluence Analytics’ CEO Conor Platt.

Confluence sells ESG (environmental, social and governance) analytics tools. Among other things, it can analyze how much ESG contributes to performance, and can also forecast future ESG. Previously, Platt cofounded a sustainable investment manager, and was an investment banker at Brown Brothers Harriman.

Companies with high ESG tend to outperform; companies with rising ESG do even better, says Platt. ESG “allows you to focus your capital on the less risky companies, and if you do this process over and over again, you should outperform.”

This year, Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares are up 35%, while Disney (DIS) shares are down 18.5%, battered by the extended closure of its global theme parks, including Disney World. Netflix has benefited from widespread stay-at-home orders.

Still, Netflix has a weak ESG rating, largely based on its corporate governance. Platt ticks off a list of shareholder-unfriendly measures. In the past few years, shareholder majorities have voted to elect directors annually, and require that any directors who were elected received a majority vote. That didn’t happen. Shareholders have voted against Richard Barton, the venture capitalist who has served on Netflix’s board since 2002; governance experts say longstanding directors aren’t very independent. Still, Barton continues to serve, and is up for reelection at the company’s June 4 annual meeting, according to Platt.

Shareholders have voted in favor of proxy access, which would allow long-term shareholders to nominate directors. “To our knowledge, none of those proposals were implemented by the Board,” he says. “The Netflix approach to governance appears to ignore proxy votes whenever legally possible.”

Netflix, which published its first ESG report this year, declined to comment. In its report, Netflix noted that women make up a third of its board, and that its goal “is to maximize long-term shareholder value most effectively.”

While Netflix ranks in the bottom half of Confluence’s ESG ratings Disney ranks in the top 20%. It’s partly because of that superior rating that Platt prefers Disney.

Ultimately, fundamental reasons will drive Disney shares higher, says Platt. He’s impressed by Disney’s entrance into the streaming market, which “could be an interesting catalyst in regards to Netflix’s longstanding record of poor governance.” Disney says it now has 54.5 million Disney+ subscribers. Growing competition for Netflix should intensify, from Fox (FOXA), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL). And a reopening of the theme parks could boost results.

Meanwhile, Disney fetches just 2.3 times sales, while Netflix is priced at nine times.

Platt’s forecast: “Netflix should underperform the market and sector by over 1% while we expect Disney to decline marginally. An investor can short Netflix, use the proceeds to buy Disney, and get a free ticket to all of the other Disney properties outside of streaming.”

118,"Apple, Google release technology for coronavirus-tracking apps",http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-google-release-technology-for-coronavirus-tracking-apps-2020-05-20,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple AAPL, +0.64% and Alphabet’s GOOGL, +0.46% GOOG, +0.54% Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

Some privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security. But others, including Ryan Calo, a law professor who co-directs the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab, said he is concerned about its effectiveness if people get too many false alerts asking them to quarantine themselves. He said public health agencies would be better off being able to track location with careful safeguards.

Calo said Google and Apple have been more upfront about the limitations of their model, but he said he’s still worried some governments will treat it as a substitute for crucial investments in free, widespread testing and hiring an army of human contact tracers.

“We’re just not going to get out of this global pandemic with a clever app,” he said."
119,How to Play the Rebalancing of the Russell Indexes,https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778,None,"Text size

Late June brings the end of the school year—and one of the highest trading-volume days on U.S. stock markets. It’s when FTSE Russell rebalances its U.S. equity indexes. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, both annual traditions will look very different this year.

Some $9 trillion is benchmarked to FTSE Russell’s U.S. indexes by both passive instruments and active managers. The best-known indexes are the large-cap Russell 1000 and the small-cap Russell 2000.

This year’s reshuffle will feature particularly high turnover and changes in index weights because it follows a steep selloff and a rapid-but-uneven bounce off the market bottom.

Tech stocks are expected to claim a greater presence in large-cap growth and value indexes, while industrials will shift to value from growth across market caps. The smallest companies in the Russell 2000 index, meanwhile, will get smaller—and could bottom out below $100 million in market value, which would be the lowest since the financial crisis.

For investors, the run-up to the rebalancing presents an opportunity to get ahead of some of the fund flows into and out of stocks that are joining or leaving the indexes.

Russell will release its preliminary indexes on June 5. They are based on May 8 prices, which allows analysts and investors to approximate the lists ahead of time. The actual rebalancing will take place after the market closes on Friday, June 26. Tens of billions of dollars of shares will be traded in the closing minutes to align with the new indexes.

Bank of America Securities anticipates that more than 200 stocks will move in and out of Russell’s indexes, with more shifting between their growth and value subindexes.

Those will be determined based on May 31 data including price-to-book ratios, five-year sales growth, and forward earnings estimates. But because FTSE Russell aims to keep the total market cap of growth and value indexes the same, the number of stocks in each can differ.

The Russell 1000 growth index will have its greatest concentration of companies in history this year, while the value benchmark will have the highest number of stocks ever, says Savita Subramanian, BofA’s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy.

“The market has grown really oligopolistic, and we’ve seen a really focused group of growth companies taking share,” Subramanian says. “The value or old-economy companies are all getting relatively smaller and smaller.”

The greatest sector-weight shift will occur in the Russell Midcap growth index, where health care’s weight rises to 23%, from 17%. That’s driven by relative outperformance from small-cap biotechs growing into mid-cap valuations.

In the Cards Buying Pressure

Selling Pressure Source: Jefferies

Russell index inclusion is a big deal for companies seeking a broader shareholder base and trading liquidity for their shares. Private-equity firm KKR (ticker: KKR), for example, has cited Russell index inclusion in 2020 as a strategic priority. If added to the Russell 1000, KKR shares could see $644 million worth of buying pressure from exchange-traded funds and passive investors, equal to almost seven trading days of average volume for the stock, estimates Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis.

That is a lot of extra demand, but nowhere near what some thinly traded small-caps entering the Russell 2000 could see. DeSanctis points to Atlas Technical Consultants (ATCX), SWK Holdings (SWKH), and Auburn National Bancorp (AUBN) as among the shares that could have hundreds of times greater buying pressure than their average daily volumes.

Passive selling, meanwhile, could weigh on other shares. Telehealth provider Teladoc Health (TDOC) has more than doubled this year, lifting its market value to $13 billion. That may earn it a promotion from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000, adding it to the investible universe of funds that use the large-cap index as a benchmark. But it also means that Teladoc will go from being one of the largest Russell 2000 companies to among the smallest in the Russell 1000, greatly reducing its weight in an index dominated by market-cap behemoths Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN).

Passive and ETF selling could mean $828 million in outflows from Teladoc shares, per DeSanctis’ projections, or about 1.3 days to trade. Bank of Princeton (BPRN), TowneBank (TOWN), and Brown-Forman’s (BF.A) Class A shares are among the stocks that could see the greatest selling pressure, relative to their average trading volume as a result of the reshuffle.

Traders and hedge funds approach the rebalancing several months before with multiple strategies. The simplest is to buy the stocks that could get a boost from buying by ETFs and other passive investors, thanks to being reclassified into a more-popular index or having their relative weight increase. Ditto for shorting shares moving in the opposite direction.

After the market volatility this year, the trade hasn’t been as straightforward. That could mean lower participation from risk-taking traders, lower liquidity, and more difficulty exiting positions. “There’s always great interest in the Russell rebalance—that mind-set hasn’t changed,” says John Spensieri, head of U.S. equity trading at Stifel. “But I think people are very concerned about the number of participants that are willing to take risk this year in offsetting the rebalance.”

The greater-than-usual scale of the rebalance this year might not yet be reflected in market bets. For investors able to stomach more volatility over the coming month, the rebalancing trade payoff could be higher than in most years.

121,The Secret to Tech's Resilience to COVID-19- Infrastructure Expansion,https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/05/16093892/the-secret-to-techs-resilience-to-covid-19-infrastructure-expansion,None,"Covid-19 has given many words an entirely new meaning. Bluechips being the first, as their definition involves performing well during downturns. Yet the modern world has never seen such a downturn where the entire economy is literally put on a virtual standstill.

As performing well became next to impossible with supply chain disruptions, store closures, and ultimately governments keeping half of the human population shelter-in-place to help contain the spread of this invisible enemy, we started to focus on ‘resilient' companies. And just like in downturns, we always turn to Big Tech. And their earnings proved they are indeed resilient to COVID-19 two weeks ago, it still inflicted pain but the tech empire is striking back by expanding its infrastructure and devoting significant funds to fight back.

As this has been the week of retail earnings, social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) made its biggest push yet into e-commerce on Tuesday. With the debut of Shops, it allows small businesses to make virtual storefronts out of their business profiles both on Facebook and Instagram. Its stock got a huge boost as it partnered with Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) to bring the tech industry together to help troubled entrepreneurs succeed at a critical time.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is among the sore spots as despite being labeled as the ‘winner' of the pandemic, its profits were less than expected due to COVID-19 costs which are expected to wipe out even the next quarter's profit. Along with raging employees that don't feel safe and protected with the company's health protocols in place and the fact its competitive advantage, Prime delivery, is unknown when to be resumed, the company is not at all in an envious position. However, Amazon's success story is nothing short of extraordinary and we shouldn't take this is a sign the company is in trouble as AWS booked more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time and we know that the company's rulebook is to reinvest profits back into the company. Devoting the profit to fight COVID-19 could help Amazon indeed become the winner of the pandemic and emerge out of it even stronger.

One which surely thrived during the pandemic is Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) as besides reporting double the amount of forecasted subscribers that now form its base of 182.86 million, the streaming giant has growth potential ahead. But its cash balance is not as rich as that of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) that has $83 billion in disposable cash to cover quite a few years of expenses. With its latest quarter, Netflix showed quite a burden with $14.7 billion of debt and only $5.15 billion in cash. Fortunately, monthly subscriptions bring in a recurring revenue stream to pay expenses and invest in new content, but filming and voice-dubbing for foreign releases have been put on hold. Fortunately, several projects have already competed so despite not being an ideal situation, it didn't dim its thriving success during the pandemic that even cemented its global status with further opportunities in Asia-Pacific and India.

Outlook

Even Apple will face problems if its subscriptions and sales-based revenues no longer continue making up for its lost iPhone sales, the company's last invention which you will agree is not at all recent so value-adding innovations are always the only way forward. This is how Big Tech has expanded into building the digital infrastructure by taking a bigger hold on media, shipping, and retail. It gave the world what it needs to weather an unprecedented economic shutdown and it is looking stronger than ever as we are more reliant on it than ever before.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries must now focus on investment in public health and protecting jobs and companies and worry about fiscal sustainability later, the European Commission said on Wednesday, departing from its usual calls for prudent policies and reforms.

In its annual recommendations to the bloc's 27 countries, called the European Semester, the EU executive said the EU should coordinate its approach to economic recovery once the coronavirus pandemic subsides.

""This Spring semester package has been recast and streamlined to provide guidance to our Member States as they navigate their way through the storm. For this immediate phase, our focus is on investing in public health and protecting jobs and companies,"" Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.

""Once conditions allow, we will need to strike a balance between achieving fiscal sustainability while also stimulating investment,"" he said.

European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Paolo Gentiloni said that during the recovery from the EU's deepest ever recession expected this year, investment and reform should be focused on the ""green"" and digital transitions and ensuring social fairness.

""That also means everyone must pay their share: there can be no place for aggressive tax planning in a Europe of solidarity and fairness,"" he said in an apparent swipe at tech giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which the EU has long argued are not paying their fair share of taxes where they make money."

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major averages on Wall St were poised for their fourth gain in five session on Wednesday as investors again bet on a swift economic recovery from coronavirus-driven lockdowns and the potential for more stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve.

The S&P 500 stands at a two-month high and was briefly above its 100-day moving average, a closely watched technical indicator that has acted as a resistance level. The Nasdaq was trading at its highest level in three months and was about 5% below record levels, as shares of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) surged to all-time highs.

Gains were broad-based, with each of the 11 major S&P sectors on the plus side. The small-cap index, which usually leads gains out of a recession, outperformed the large-cap indexes.

Still, with economic data likely to be dismal in the coming weeks, there is concern that stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves, with the S&P up nearly 33% from its March 23 closing low.

""Once the economy shut down, we had very little clarity with respect to numbers and measurements, the whole marketplace is sort of flying blind,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading at Harvest Volatility Management in New York. ""This market is swept up in a very powerful trend and along the way it is very confident in itself. There hasn’t been much doubt that we are over our skis.""

Minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting showed the central bank pledged to act as appropriate to support the economy until it is on track to recovery, a sentiment that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has voiced in recent days.

The rose 360.8 points, or 1.49%, to 24,567.66, the S&P 500 gained 47.95 points, or 1.64%, to 2,970.89, and the added 174.88 points, or 1.9%, to 9,359.99.

Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to vote again next week on giving small businesses more time to utilize their coronavirus aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday.

As states across the country begin to loosen restrictions, hopes for an economic rebound have grown. The NYSE Arca airlines index jumped 5.35% as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: )'s chief executive officer said he was confident travel will return in the next 12 to 18 months.

Target Corp (NYSE: ) lost 2.86% after the big box retailer reported a 64% plunge in quarterly profit, as costs related to the coronavirus outbreak outweighed a surge in online sales.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and nine new lows."

(Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open sharply higher on Wednesday as investors clung to hopes of a recovery from a coronavirus-fuelled slump amid signs of more stimulus for ailing sectors, while retailer Lowe's jumped on upbeat quarterly results.

The home improvement chain rose 5.5% in premarket trading after posting higher first-quarter same-store sales as coronavirus lockdowns led people to spend more on home remodelling and repairs.

The U.S. stock market has now rallied more than 30% from March lows on unprecedented stimulus, but gains have been limited this month as traders digest mixed headlines on progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine.

The S&P 500 tumbled 1% in the final hour of Tuesday's session after a report raised doubts about positive results from Moderna Inc's early-stage trial for a vaccine to prevent against the respiratory disease.

""We don't expect very big gains from here but we don't expect a downward trend either,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

""As the lockdowns are eased and the coronavirus epidemic is brought under control in more and more countries, some recovery in the economy is already factored into the equity prices.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the government and the central bank were considering more measures to ensure the worst-stricken areas of the economy received adequate support.

All eyes are now on minutes due later in the day from the Fed's latest policy meeting where it maintained interest rates near zero.

At 7:46 a.m. ET, were up 279 points, or 1.15%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 32 points, or 1.1% and were up 92.75 points, or 1%.

Target Corp (NYSE: ) reported a 64% plunge in quarterly profit, pummeled by costs to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, but its shares rose on the back of a jump in online sales.

Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc rose between 0.9% and 2.6%, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co gained about 2%.

Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: ) rose 3.1% after its chief executive officer said he was confident travel will return in the next 12 to 18 months. United Airlines Holdings gained 3.5%.

Photographer: Keith Bedford/Bloomberg 2/2

(Bloomberg) -- Problems getting cash handouts to Japanese households and businesses amid the virus pandemic show that the country’s administration is a decade behind in terms of technology, a state minister said.

Masaaki Taira, who heads a team set up a month ago to enlist private-sector tech companies’ help with efforts to control the virus, said the pandemic should be used as an opportunity to shift the administration into the digital world.

“The government hasn’t been able to keep pace with technological progress as it should,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Politicians and bureaucrats didn’t have a strong enough awareness, or they may have paid too much heed to those who were wary of it.”

Local government online application systems for cash handouts have hit so many snags that some areas are advising people to save time by sending written applications. The use of name stamps known as “hanko” in office work forced some workers to keep commuting to their offices even as the infection spread, hampering efforts to contain the virus by reducing personal contacts.

This comes as neighbors such China, South Korea and Taiwan have tapped into technology in their virus battles and developed apps that aid in items ranging from minimizing person-to-person contact to making sure people can find protective masks at stores.

Japan has yet to introduce a smartphone Bluetooth app for virus contact tracing, which the government had hoped to launch in May, but it could face delays. Taira said the government was awaiting specifications from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Google (NASDAQ: ) and that he couldn’t say when the app would come into use.

As Japan prepares to lift a state of emergency in more areas of the country, it should look to use the crisis as a technological opportunity, Taira said.

“Japan has a history of moving its capital city in response to infectious diseases,” he said. After the coronavirus, it should move its capital into the digital world, he added.

131,What Is Contact Tracing and How Does It Work?,https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/what-is-contact-tracing-how-does-it-work,2020-05-22 19:51:27+00:00,"Contact tracing has been around for decades and could prove to be a lifesaver in the time of COVID-19. Learn the details of contact tracing.

For Dan Bailey, there was no learning curve when he came face-to-face with a contract tracing experience stemming from COVID-19.

Bailey, president of WikiLawn Care, an online resource for lawn care professionals, was contacted in early May by local public health officials and told he’d been in contact with someone who had tested positive for the coronavirus.

He says the experience was a strange one, to say the least.

“When I got my call, I wasn't told the name of the infected patient,” he said. “I was just told that I'd come into contact with someone who was verified as testing positive for the coronavirus.”

Once contacted, Bailey said he was given knowledge and resources and told what to do for the next 14 days to limit his contact with other individuals. “I was told I didn't have to get a test unless I started showing symptoms, but since they were allowing testing for asymptomatic people at that point anyway, I went ahead and got tested.”

For Bailey, the entire contact tracing process was new and somewhat startling. Past that, though, he says he understands the need for it during a time of the pandemic.

“The whole process of contact tracing was painless and not at all as invasive as I think people make it out to be,” he said. “When I first heard the phrase, it seemed a little alarming to me, and I wondered how much information would be kept private in the face of a public health crisis. But from what I saw, I'm pleased to see contact tracing is keeping the public safe while still maintaining patient privacy.""

What Is Contact Tracing?

Contact tracing was around long before there were apps or smartphones, and was used for decades to help eradicate smallpox and to help control the spread of HIV. It's never been a very high-tech process, only a manual one that involves tenacity and dedication on the part of public health staff.

How Contact Tracing Works

“Contact tracing is the organized recorded tracing of human movement and the spread of the disease over specific geographical regions,” said Brad Ducorsky, chief executive officer at a UBsafe, a contact tracing app that’s set for a late May rollout. “Contact tracing allows for the government and health institutions to see the spread and direction of the disease in near real-time while alerting individuals of high-risk areas.""

“When done right and in a scientifically relevant manner, we will be able to stave off the spread of the virus by isolating areas of infection and encouraging focused testing,” Ducorsky said.

According to the CDC, once a patient is tested and confirmed infected, the contact tracing process for coronavirus involves:

Public health staff interview a patient to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during a recent timeframe.

to help them recall everyone with whom they have had close contact during a recent timeframe. Public health staff then warn the exposed individuals (contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, usually by phone.

(contacts) of their potential exposure as rapidly and sensitively as possible, usually by phone. To protect the original patient’s privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed, but not the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.

contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed, but not the identity of the patient who may have exposed them. Contacts are then provided with education, information, and support to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they do not feel ill.

to understand their risk, what they should do to separate themselves from others who are not exposed, monitor themselves for illness, and the possibility that they could spread the infection to others even if they do not feel ill. Contacts are encouraged to stay home and maintain social distance from others (at least 6 feet) until 14 days after their last exposure, in case they also become ill.

“By and large, the goal is to map an individuals' physical contact with other people over a predetermined amount of time,” said Kristian Romero, a senior marketing manager at VirtualHealth, a health care management firm based in New York, N.Y. “The person's risk of having the disease in question (likely COVID-19, in this case) is assessed based on variables like symptoms, length of time from contact with a known carrier, and/or a positive test,” Romero said.

Once contacted, an individual is asked many questions about where they have gone and with whom they have interacted to determine where (and to whom) the infection may have spread.

The type of information gathered can include public and private locations where the person went; where they may have interacted with businesses or their respective staff; and names and phone numbers of known people the individual came into contact with (like family, friends, co-workers, and acquaintances, Romero said.

“Contract tracing also targets levels of potential exposure, like prolonged face-to-face meetings versus briefly speaking with a bartender across a bar,” Romero said.

Once that data is established, the contact tracing firm and/or a public health office will contact these businesses and individuals that the person at-risk visited. “At that point, people who came in contact with an infected individual can self-quarantine and get their COVID-19 evaluations,” Romero added. ""That process aims to check individuals who may be at risk based on symptoms and who are monitored to see if any symptoms arise in a few days or a few weeks.”

The entire contact tracing procedure is highly labor-intensive, Romero noted. ""It usually requires a dedicated effort of specialists to call and document a potentially large group of people,"" she said. ""It also requires a sophisticated enough platform for data entry and storage to make sure that anyone who needs monitoring or treatment.""

Cooperation and trust from Americans is a critical component of contact-tracing success.

How Are Apps and Smart Phones Used?

The use of contact tracing apps is an emerging public health tool in the fight against COVID-19.

The apps are intended to support the contact tracing process, not replace it, by helping speed up the public health workers' painstaking process of finding everyone a patient has been in close contact with, according to CNET.

The state of Texas recently signed a $295 million contract with a contact tracing firm, which will help the state monitor residents as to who they’ve been with, when they’ve been with them, and where they were together. The goal is to track and isolate Americans who’ve either tested positive for coronavirus or been in contact with someone who has been exposed to the virus.

“Technology and smartphones are making contact tracing accessible for most Americans, and it will take most Americans to make this technology as accurate and impactful as possible,” Ducorsky said. “Through the use of GPS-based geolocation, real-time data analytics, and self-reporting, it is very possible for Covid-19 tracking in the U.S. in a very short time.”

“Once enough Americans adopt a contact-tracing application, we can make data-based intelligent decisions to help slow down the COVID-19 spread as we all wait for a vaccine,” he said.

The actual contact tracing process using an app isn’t all that complicated or invasive as it sounds. One app allows a person who has tested positive to voluntarily upload information to a server that then lets others find out they've been near someone infected, according to CNET. It can also let you find out if you've been near others who have the disease. It doesn't share your identity, phone number or location with anyone, including the government.

Visualizing the Contract Tracing Process

Privacy Issues Are Still a Big Concern for Many

Even as the pandemic rolls on, Americans aren’t exactly sold on contact tracing, mostly due to privacy issues. Many U.S. adults don’t believe that tracing is effective, anyway.

According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, six in 10 Americans say that if the government tracked people’s locations through their cellphone it would not make much of a difference in limiting the spread of the virus.

In April, Google (GOOGL) - Get Report and Apple (AAPL) - Get Report announced a plan to boost contact tracing effectiveness across the U.S. leveraging Bluetooth communications technology. That news raised eyebrows, as well.

""No contact tracing app can be fully effective until there is widespread, free, and quick testing and equitable access to health care,” said Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “These systems also can’t be effective if people don’t trust them. People will only trust these systems if they protect privacy, remain voluntary, and store data on an individual's device, not a centralized repository.”

“At the same time, we must be realistic that such contact tracing methods are likely to exclude many vulnerable members of society who lack access to technology and are already being disproportionately impacted by the pandemic,” Granick said. “We will remain vigilant moving forward to make sure any contact tracing app remains voluntary and decentralized, and used only for public health purposes and only for the duration of this pandemic."""

By Paresh Dave

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The University of Alabama System will require students and staff returning to its three campuses in the coming months to submit online health checks regularly and encourage them to download its contact tracing app, officials told Reuters on Thursday.

Researchers at several dozen U.S. universities are developing mobile apps that aim to curb new infections of the novel coronavirus, but Alabama is one of the first U.S. school systems to move forward on deploying such an app.

Students and employees will be reminded to sign into a website with their school login credentials every three days and report whether they have any symptoms related to COVID-19, the sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by the virus.

Those reluctant to fill it out may be asked to stay away from campus, but an official enforcement system has not been finalized, said Selwyn Vickers, dean of University of Alabama at Birmingham's (UAB) school of medicine.

The contact tracing mobile app, which is being built by Birmingham-based software developer MotionMobs, will use programming code released on Wednesday by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Google that notifies people who were near users reporting as virus-positive. Users can remain anonymous the entire time.

Its use will not be required because some phones cannot operate the app, and Apple and Google also set rules preventing institutions and the state from making it mandatory, said Sue Feldman, director of graduate programs in health informatics at UAB.

But the app will be open to anyone in Alabama, she said, and some Birmingham-based companies such as Altec Inc and Regions Bank are considering telling employees to use the contact tracing and health assessment tools.

""We are encouraged by the progress being made and look forward to learning more about the contact tracing system under development,"" said Regions Bank spokeswoman Evelyn Mitchell."

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes surged and the Nasdaq hit a three-month high on Wednesday, as investors clung to hopes of a recovery from a coronavirus-fueled slump amid signs of more stimulus for ailing sectors.

The tech-heavy index, now about 5% below its all-time high hit in February, boosted by Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc , which were trading at record levels, as well as Apple Inc .

The S&P 500 was about 12% below its all-time peak and the Dow Jones index was short by 17%.

The three indexes have rallied more than 30% from March lows on unprecedented stimulus, but gains have been capped this month as traders digest mixed headlines on progress in developing a coronavirus vaccine.

The S&P 500 tumbled 1% in the final hour of Tuesday's session after a report raised doubts about positive results from Moderna Inc's early-stage trial for a COVID-19 vaccine.

""We don't expect very big gains from here, but we don't expect a downward trend either,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

""As the lockdowns are eased and the coronavirus epidemic is brought under control in more and more countries, some recovery in the economy is already factored into the equity prices.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the government and the central bank were considering more steps to ensure the worst-hit areas of the economy received adequate support. eyes are now on the minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting expected at 2 p.m. ET or 1800 GMT.

By Elizabeth Culliford

(Reuters) - The regulation of big technology companies such as Facebook Inc (O: ) and Alphabet Inc's (O: ) Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.

Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Donald Trump and his likely Democratic opponent Joe Biden on some key tech policy issues:

BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES

Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc (O: ).

Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, regularly bashing Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos but meeting with Apple Inc (O: )'s Tim Cook, has said ""there is something going on in terms of monopoly"" when asked about big tech firms.

The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies, but both he and Biden have stopped short of calling for the firms to be broken up.

Biden has said dismantling companies like Facebook was ""something we should take a really hard look at.""

REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA

Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives.

Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its policies on political ads and manipulated videos, was the only Democratic presidential candidate who called for revoking Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a key internet law which largely exempts online platforms like Facebook and Twitter (N: ) from legal liability for users' posts.

In 2018, Trump signed into law a bill that makes websites liable for third-party content that facilitates prostitution or sex trafficking. But this year, in a win for tech firms, Trump also signed a trade deal that means tech companies will have U.S.-style liability protections for online content when operating in Mexico and Canada.

DATA PRIVACY

Congress has been trying to build consensus on a federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration has signaled support for. Biden has said the U.S. should set privacy ""standards not unlike the Europeans,"" an apparent reference to the European Union's stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Trump administration has criticized Silicon Valley over the issue of encryption, blasting Apple for what he called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals.

Privacy advocates have also slammed the Trump administration for actions they say violate immigrants' privacy and for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data.

DIGITAL DIVIDE

The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.

Trump has said he is committed to ensuring ""every citizen can have high-speed internet access,"" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund.

Biden also said he plans a $20 billion (£16.31 billion) investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations."

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. flag and a smartphone with the Huawei and 5G network logo are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustratio

By Josh Horwitz

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The latest U.S. government action against China's Huawei takes direct aim at the company's HiSilicon chip division -- a business that in a few short years has become central to China's ambitions in semiconductor technology but will now lose access to tools that are central to its success.

That could make it the most damaging U.S. attack yet against a Chinese company that U.S. officials told reporters Wednesday functioned as a ""tool of strategic influence"" for the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures ""arbitrary and pernicious.""

Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.

But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei's rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business.

HiSilicon's Kirin smartphone processor is now considered to be on par with those created by Apple Inc (O: ) and Qualcomm Inc (O: ) --a rare example of an advanced Chinese semiconductor product that competes globally.

HiSilicon is also central to Huawei's leadership in 5G, stepping into the breach when the United States cut off access to some U.S. chips last year.

In March, Huawei revealed that 8% of the 50,000 5G base stations it sold in 2019 came with no U.S. technology, using HiSilicon chipsets instead.

But the U.S. export control rule, first reported by Reuters last week, aims to block HiSilicon's access to two crucial tools: chip design software from U.S. firms including Cadence Design Systems Inc (O: ) and Synopsys Inc (O: ), and the manufacturing prowess of ""foundries,"" led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW: ), that build chips for many of the world's top semiconductor firms.

With the new restrictions，HiSilicon ""will be in a situation where they’re not able to manufacture chips at all, or if they do, then they’re not leading edge anymore,"" says Stewart Randall, who tracks China's chip industry at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.

Without its own processors, Huawei will lose its edge over domestic smartphone rivals, analysts said. International sales had already been gutted by a ban on the use of key Google (NASDAQ: ) software.

Industry sources say Huawei has stockpiled chips, and the new U.S. rule will not go into full force for 120 days. U.S. officials also note that licenses could be granted for some technologies. HiSilicon can also keep using design software it has already acquired.

HILSILICON IN TOUGH SPOT

Still, analysts agree HiSilicon is in a tough spot. Nearly all chip factories globally -- including China's leading foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK: ) -- buy gear from the same equipment makers, led by U.S. firms Applied Materials Inc (O: ), Lam Research Corp (O: ) and KLA Corp (O: ).

The new U.S. rule requires licenses for companies using U.S. machinery to build Huawei-designed chips and delivered to the Chinese firm. To be sure, the new rule will not catch items shipped to a third party, allowing HiSilicon's fabricators like TSMC the ability to ship chips to HiSilicon’s device manufacturers who can send them directly to a customer.

While there are alternatives to American machines - Japan's Tokyo Electron Ltd (T: ), for example, makes gear that competes with Applied Materials - replacing U.S. technology is not as simple as swapping out a machine.

“You almost have to think about it like a heart transplant,"" said VLSI Research Chief Executive Dan Hutcheson, noting that chip production lines are finely calibrated systems where everything has to work well together.

Doug Fuller of the City University of Hong Kong said Huawei had a few options. It could slip around the rule by having suppliers ship directly to Huawei customers, though the U.S. officials said they would be vigilant about such workarounds.

Huawei and the Chinese government could re-double efforts to build production capabilities that did not require U.S. tools, by investing in nascent Chinese competitors and buying from Japanese and Korean firms, even if that required quality sacrifices.

Or Huawei could turn away from HiSilicon and revert to buying from overseas suppliers -- just not American ones. ""There’s talk of Huawei just turning to Samsung (KS: ) processors,"" for its smartphone, said Fuller.

Semi Equipment Vendors in Crosshairs of U.S.-China Trade War

The stage seems to be set for the next phase of the U.S.-China trade war, as the White House recently tightened restrictions on China. The new rules require semiconductor manufacturers using U.S. manufacturing equipment to obtain a special license to sell to companies blacklisted by the U.S. The most notable player listed is Huawei, simply because its size puts a large number of its suppliers in jeopardy. Beijing’s promise of repercussions means even greater uncertainty for the segment.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tweeted: “We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.” Huawei was earlier blacklisted on national security concerns with the U.S. alleging that the company was using its equipment for spying.

Fearing that its business, which includes not just Apple and other U.S. players but also China’s Huawei would be impacted, Taiwan Semiconductor agreed to set up a 5nm manufacturing unit in Arizona. While this takes care of alleged security issues, it’s unlikely to get the company off the hook, as Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department told Bloomberg. He said that the company wouldn’t be able to obtain a license based on the unit it was building in the U.S. “That’s not part of it at all... There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”

Huawei has already started moving lagging edge business to China’s SMIC, but this move will leave it hanging, because it has developed leading edge designs for manufacture in TSM’s 7nm process for incorporation in its smartphones among other things. So Huawei’s reaction was as expected. Its consumer electronics head Richard Yu wrote on WeChat, “The so-called cybersecurity reasons are merely an excuse…The key is the threat to the technology hegemony of the U.S.” That does have a ring of truth in it.

China’s Communist Party-backed Global Times carried an article saying that Beijing was ready to initiate countermeasures, including the imposition of restrictions on Apple, suspension of the purchase of Boeing airplanes and putting U.S. companies on an ‘unreliable entity list.’

The transfer of manufacturing to China has happened over a number of years and as things stand today, much of the talent and manufacturing capacity exists in the region. Until China manufactures all of its own equipment however, it remains a huge opportunity for American suppliers like Applied Materials, KLA Corp. and Lam Research. These are the sales currently at risk. The equipment makers were all down over 4% in the last trading session and could remain under pressure today, especially in the backdrop of the pandemic.

Security concerns aren’t a trifling matter, however, and the ability to spy on personal and governmental interactions through hardware tweaks is also a concern we cant brush aside. Since Chinese companies are legally bound to share information with the Chinese government, it isn't too far-fetched an idea that Huawei with its significant reach isn't workng to further the goverment's plans.

Additionally, this falling out between the partners was bound to happen one day as the dynamics in the relationship changed. Whether having it happen sooner rather than later is better is anyone’s guess. We seem to be looking at the longer term right now.

141,Will Reliance Become Debt Free By End Of March 2021?,https://in.investing.com/analysis/will-reliance-become-debt-free-by-end-of-march-2021-200439911,None,"Most of the companies design their business model broadly in two ways. Firstly, by offering high-end products which can be bought by rich and ultra-rich? Like Ferrari (NYSE: ), though they sell less than 100 cars in a year they still make huge profits and have established themselves as a well-recognized brand. Secondly, by capturing the huge market share by offering products where there are high demand and the price of these products is less but still will make profits because the fixed cost will be less with increasing the customer base.



One of Asia’s richest persons, Mukesh Ambani opted for the second business model foreseeing the exponential growth in the demand for the data in the coming years, and he strongly believed that data will be the next fuel. In the year 2016, Ambani invested around $40 billion to launch Jio by providing free data and calling services for a few months which made the user get used to high usage of the internet. This exactly worked for capturing a huge market share in the well-established and hyper-competitive telecom sector.



Initially, Jio focused only on providing data and calling services but with time, Ambani started investing and acquiring various related products.



To compete with the products like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Cortana, Google (NASDAQ: ) Assistant and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Alexa which are driven by the conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), Jio bought 87 percent stake in Haptik for Rs. 700 Crore in 2019.



Many of the technology companies observed that Indians have been transiting from using local music store to using music streaming app, so Reliance Jio bought music streaming app Saavn and integrated with Jio music for Rs 720 crore in 2018 which became a competitor for Amazon Music, Gaana, Spotify, Wynk, and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Music.



Starting with providing free data to customers, now Reliance Jio has identified that it should expand its fiber network. So, to cope up with the competition it bought a 66 percent stake in Den Networks (NS: ) for Rs. 2045 crore and 51.3 percent stake in Hathway Cable (NS: ) and Datacom for Rs. 2490 crore both of which have a well-established network in India.



The dream of the billionaire is to make Reliance Jio as stop shop for all digital needs and to clear the huge debt on the company by the end of March 2021. In 2019, Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Reliance to power the Indian company’s data centers with its Azure cloud.



RIL has also initiated fundraising of Rs. 53,125 Crs in the form of right issues, the right issue is 1:15 that means every existing shareholder who holds 15 shares or more can purchase one share at a discounted price Rs. 1257 per share. Apart from the discounted share price the investor should understand the reason for the fundraising and business model of the companies.



The tech giant Facebook (NASDAQ: ) has been trying hard to enter into India for providing its digital services. Although it succeeded in attracting a higher user base in India than in any other country, it failed to provide other services. So Facebook also needed a partner who is well established in various segments with a large subscription, which is Reliance Jio.



Facebook has bought a 9.9 percent stake in its telecom arm Jio of Reliance Industries (NS: ) Limited for Rs. 43,574 crore valuation. The deal might be to provide an application that provides various features including digital payments, social media, gaming along with flight and hotel booking options, among others.



The second deal comes within a week from the first deal with Facebook. The deal with US-based private equity firm Silver Lake, also in the same procedure to reduce the debt of the Reliance Jio. The deal is to sell a 1.15 percent stake in Jio for Rs. 5,655.75 crore at an enterprise value at Rs. 5.15 lakh crore which is 12.5% premium to the value indicated by Facebook. The sole reason for these investors to invest in Jio is due to the massive customer base which Jio has established by providing free calling and data.



The third deal comes within a week from the second deal. The US-based investment firm Vista’s Investment had agreed to infuse Rs. 11,367 crores for an equity stake of 2.32 percent in the Jio Communication at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore.



Within three weeks, Reliance Jio had raised more than Rs. 60,000 crore which will help RIL meet its target of eliminating $21.4 billion of net debt by the end of the year.



Apart from these deals, Reliance is in talks with the Saudi Aramco (SE: ) for stake sell in the oil business, and with the Canadian private equity firm Brookfield Asset Management for a stake in its telecom tower business.



The financial and technological infusion by various companies will boost the Reliance Jio's presence in various sectors. But how is it going to affect India’s telecom sector?



Most of the telecom firms have already succumbed to AGR dues which should be paid within a short period. Most of the companies have paid amounts that were based on their self-assessment, but the Supreme Court has rejected it and asked companies to pay the full amount. Reliance Jio is the only company that paid almost all AGR dues which gives an advantage to it. Due to pandemic and economic slowdown, the companies are unable to add new subscribers, which is creating a negative impact but Reliance Jio which has around 384 million subscribers. As India is preparing for its 5G services, the companies need huge funds to buy the spectrum, the latest financial infusion into the Reliance Jio is another advantage to Jio as compared to the competitors."
142,"Japan’s Government 10 Years Behind on Tech, Minister Says",https://in.investing.com/news/japans-government-10-years-behind-on-tech-minister-says-2265907,None,"(Bloomberg) -- Problems getting cash handouts to Japanese households and businesses amid the virus pandemic show that the country’s administration is a decade behind in terms of technology, a state minister said.

Masaaki Taira, who heads a team set up a month ago to enlist private-sector tech companies’ help with efforts to control the virus, said the pandemic should be used as an opportunity to shift the administration into the digital world.

“The government hasn’t been able to keep pace with technological progress as it should,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “Politicians and bureaucrats didn’t have a strong enough awareness, or they may have paid too much heed to those who were wary of it.”

Local government online application systems for cash handouts have hit so many snags that some areas are advising people to save time by sending written applications. The use of name stamps known as “hanko” in office work forced some workers to keep commuting to their offices even as the infection spread, hampering efforts to contain the virus by reducing personal contacts.

This comes as neighbors such China, South Korea and Taiwan have tapped into technology in their virus battles and developed apps that aid in items ranging from minimizing person-to-person contact to making sure people can find protective masks at stores.

Japan has yet to introduce a smartphone Bluetooth app for virus contact tracing, which the government had hoped to launch in May, but it could face delays. Taira said the government was awaiting specifications from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Google (NASDAQ: ) and that he couldn’t say when the app would come into use.

As Japan prepares to lift a state of emergency in more areas of the country, it should look to use the crisis as a technological opportunity, Taira said.

“Japan has a history of moving its capital city in response to infectious diseases,” he said. After the coronavirus, it should move its capital into the digital world, he added.

143,China’s Got a New Plan to Seize the World’s Tech Crown From the U.S.,https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-got-a-new-plan-to-seize-the-worlds-tech-crown-from-the-us-2265874,None,"(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is accelerating its bid for global leadership in key technologies, planning to pump more than a trillion dollars into the economy through the rollout of everything from wireless networks to artificial intelligence.

In the masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China will invest an estimated $1.4 trillion over six years to 2025, calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. to lay fifth generation wireless networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software that will underpin autonomous driving to automated factories and mass surveillance.

The new infrastructure initiative is expected to drive mainly local giants from Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Huawei to SenseTime Group Ltd. at the expense of U.S. companies. As tech nationalism mounts, the investment drive will reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology, echoing objectives set forth previously in the Made in China 2025 program. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.

“Nothing like this has happened before, this is China’s gambit to win the global tech race,” said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. “Starting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.”

The tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China’s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country’s worst economic performance since the Mao era.

The nation’s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC: ) Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.

Maria Kwok’s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant’s payment is late.

China is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There’s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with “dumb” bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.

What BloombergNEF Says

China’s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens (NS: ). One bet is on industrial internet-of-things platforms as China aims to cultivate three world leading companies in this area by 2025.

China isn’t alone in pumping money into the tech sector as a way to get out of the post-virus economic slump. Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its “New Deal” to create jobs and boost growth.

According to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail.

Separate estimates by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings (NASDAQ: ), Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.

Beijing’s half-formed vision is already stirring a plethora of stocks, a big reason why five of China’s 10 best-performing stocks this year are tech plays like networking gear maker Dawning Information Industry Co. and Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier GoerTek Inc. The bare outlines of the masterplan were enough to drive pundits toward everything from satellite operators to broadband providers.

It’s unlikely that U.S companies will benefit much from the tech-led stimulus and in some cases they stand to lose existing business. Earlier this year when the country’s largest telecom carrier China Mobile (NYSE: ) awarded contracts for 37 billion yuan in 5G base stations, the lion’s share went to Huawei and other Chinese companies. Sweden’s Ericsson (BS: ) got only a little over 10% of the business in the first four months. In one of its projects, Digital China will help the northeastern city of Changchun swap out American cloud computing staples IBM (NYSE: ), Oracle (NYSE: ) and EMC (NYSE: ) with home-grown technology.

It’s in data centers that a considerable chunk of the new infrastructure development will take place. Over 20 provinces have launched policies to support enterprises utilizing cloud computing services, according to a March note from UBS Group AG (NYSE: ). Tony Yu, chief executive officer of Chinese server maker H3C, that his company was seeing a significant increase in demand for data center services from some of the country’s top internet companies. “Rapid growth in up-and-coming sectors will bring a new force to China’s economy after the pandemic passes,” he told Bloomberg News.

From there, more investment should flow. Bain Capital-backed data center operator Chindata Group estimated that for every one dollar spent on data centers another $5 to $10 in investment in related sectors would take place, including in networking, power grid and advanced equipment manufacturing. “A whole host of supply-chain companies will benefit,” the company said in a statement.

There’s concern about whether this long-term strategy provides much in the way of stimulus now, and where the money will come from. “It’s impossible to prop up China’s economy with new infrastructure alone,” said Zhu Tian, professor of economics at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “If you are worried about the government’s added debt levels and their debt servicing abilities right now, of course you wouldn’t do it. But it’s a necessary thing to do at a time of crisis.”

Digital China is confident that follow-up projects from its housing initiative in Guangzhou could generate 30 million yuan in revenue for the company. It’s also hoping to replicate those efforts with local governments in the northeastern province of Jilin, where it has 3.3 billion yuan worth of projects approved. These include building a so-called city brain that will for the first time connect databases including traffic, schools and civil matters such as marriage registry. “The concept of smart cities has been touted for years but now we are finally seeing the investment,” said Kwok.

144,A nurse struggled with COVID-19 trauma. He was found dead in his car,https://www.investing.com/news/coronavirus/a-nurse-struggled-with-covid19-trauma-he-was-found-dead-in-his-car-2177913,None,"4/4 © Reuters. Nurse William Coddington wears PPE inside a hospital in West Palm Beach 2/4

By Gabriella Borter

(Reuters) - Becoming a nurse in 2018 was a dream come true for William Coddington.

He loved helping people and feeling needed at his West Palm Beach, Florida hospital. The 32-year-old was on the upswing of a decade-long battle with opioid addiction and other substance abuse, according to friends and family, who said he was committed to his recovery.

It all started to unravel in March, as fatally ill COVID-19 patients showed up in his intensive care unit.

It rattled Coddington to see patients his age die, his mother Carolyn said. He could no longer attend his 12-step recovery meetings in person. He was scared about how little personal protective equipment he had. He had nightmares about alarms going off on ventilators in the ICU.

On the night of April 24, he spoke by phone to his best friend Robert Marks and sounded distraught, Marks said. Coddington was caught between the war zone at work and his confinement at home.

“Don’t take unnecessary risks but hang in there,” Marks texted him.

The next morning, Coddington was found dead in his car in a hotel parking lot in Deerfield Beach, Florida.

His family suspects a drug overdose. A spokeswoman for the Broward County Medical Examiner's office said the case is pending. The Broward County Sheriff's Office said it is still investigating but does not suspect foul play.

Reuters reconstructed Coddington's last weeks through some of his text messages, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) posts and interviews with his parents, brother and two close friends. Reuters could not independently verify Coddington's cause of death.

Frontline (NYSE: ) healthcare workers are trying to cope with the trauma of treating the novel coronavirus, which has inundated U.S. hospitals with desperately ill patients and killed more than 90,000 Americans in less than three months.

Healthcare workers with histories of substance abuse may have more difficulty coping with fear, isolation and witnessing so much death during the pandemic, psychiatrists told Reuters. Those factors could provoke relapses in workers recovering from addiction, they said.

“Patients who are being treated for opioid use disorder have reported increased stress and opioid craving since this pandemic began,"" said Kelly Dunn, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who researches opioid use.

SCARED, BUT COMMITTED

Coddington grew up living with his mother, an executive assistant at a healthcare company, in Deerfield Beach, after his parents got divorced in 2001.

Coddington's family said he was addicted to opioids from a young age. It started with painkillers he received after a leg surgery, Coddington told his friend Skye Alexander, whom he met in nursing school.

Coddington entered inpatient rehabilitation at age 21, his mother said. When he emerged, he joined 12-step fellowships, self-help healing groups and therapy.

“He was always trying different things to find the stability to interact with the world,” said Marks, a resident of Miami Beach who knew Coddington for 10 years.

When COVID-19 patients in March started arriving at JFK Medical Center's North campus, where Coddington worked for 3 months, he volunteered for the coronavirus unit.

He did it because he was younger than some of his colleagues, and so potentially less likely to become severely ill, and because he was not a parent, said his friend Alexander.

“That was the type of person Will was,” she said.

Still, Coddington was scared, his friends said. He risked exposure and infecting his 65-year-old mother, with whom he still lived.

Palm Beach County ranks third in Florida behind Miami-Dade and Broward counties for confirmed coronavirus cases; nearly 300 people have died of COVID-19 there.

Coddington said in an April 13 Facebook post that his hospital had a shortage of protective equipment, especially crucial N95 respirator masks. He said he didn't blame his employer because the issue was widespread.

“In my hospital we are rationing 1 n95 mask for my whole shift,” Coddington wrote. “We are running out of gowns. We are having people make makeshift face shields that end up snapping.""

Days before he died, his face shield fell off while he was helping with an intubation, which involves putting tubes into patients’ airways to assist breathing, said his father Ronald, a port engineer in Palm Beach.

“He literally felt things splash on his face,” Ronald recalled his son telling him.

Kathryn Walton, a spokeswoman for JFK Medical Center, part of the hospital group HCA Healthcare (NYSE: ), declined to comment on Coddington's death except to extend condolences to his family. She said the hospital’s goal was always to protect employees.

The hospital has “adequate supplies of PPE” and is “taking steps to conserve PPE because we do not know what our future needs will be,"" Walton said.

She said the hospital offers mental health counseling by phone and video. Coddington’s friends and family say they don't know if he used those services.

'BRACING FOR IMPACT'

Coddington suffered from the social isolation imposed by the pandemic, his family and friends said.

He loved being around people, said Marks, who first met Coddington at a diner. Coddington’s “wacky” impersonations of TV characters endeared him to Marks right away.

“He was like a character all on his own,” Marks said.

Coddington relied on 12-step meetings to stay sober, but after one virtual video gathering, he told his mother it was not as helpful.

“He couldn’t meet with his sponsor,” she said. “And his friends, nobody wanted to see him because he worked in a hospital, not even to sit 6 feet apart.”

In his last weeks, Coddington came home from work, spoke little and played video games in his room, Carolyn said. His impersonations - including one of her Southern accent that always made them laugh – stopped.

His friend Alexander, of Sunrise, Florida, said she noticed the change too: ""It was despair ... creeping in.""

Coddington had relapsed before. In 2017, while on a break from nursing school, he had ended up on a ventilator, according to Alexander, who said she visited him in the hospital. She said Coddington told her he had overdosed on the club drug Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate (GHb).

With the pandemic weighing on Coddington, his loved ones were “bracing for impact,” Marks said. Carolyn checked on him constantly. His father and friends called and texted.

“You are so needed right now by others. You can be great,"" Ronald Coddington said to his son in text messages on April 1. “Please please bury me some day. Don’t make me bury you ... I love you.”

""I love you too,"" Coddington replied.

CRAVING RELIEF

The night of April 24, Coddington argued with his mother, who feared a relapse was coming. They made up, but he announced he was heading to a hotel for a good night's sleep.

Coddington kissed Carolyn and assured her she could track his location on her phone. He called Marks that evening, expressing how trapped he felt between the chaos at work and being cooped up at home.

“I couldn’t stop thinking about him because of how upset he sounded,” Marks said. Sleepless at 1:24 a.m., Marks sent his friend $20 on Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay to buy himself coffee before his shift.

Coddington never responded. Carolyn checked his location the morning of April 25. He wasn't at the hospital. She drove to the hotel and found him dead in his car.

Ronald Coddington said police told him they obtained a video, likely hotel security footage, showing his son sitting in his car in the parking lot that night when another car briefly pulled alongside. Ronald said there was ""some kind of exchange"" between his son and the other vehicle's driver that he suspects was a drug deal.

The Broward County Sheriff’s office did not respond to Reuters' request for the video.

Family members think the toxicology report, expected in a few weeks, will confirm an overdose - a temporary escape gone wrong.

“Do I think he wanted to die that night? 100% no,” said his friend Marks. “I would bet every dollar I have that it was in an effort to have some relief.”"

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open sharply

higher on Wednesday as investors clung to hopes of a recovery

from a coronavirus-fuelled slump amid signs of more stimulus for

ailing sectors, while retailer Lowe's jumped on upbeat quarterly

results.

The home improvement chain LOW.N rose 5.5% in premarket

Moderna Inc's early-stage trial for a vaccine to

prevent against the respiratory disease.

""We don't expect very big gains from here but we don't

expect a downward trend either,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets

economist at Capital Economics in London.

""As the lockdowns are eased and the coronavirus epidemic is

brought under control in more and more countries, some recovery

* Lowe's up after results

* U.S. indexes seen in tight range in near term - economist

(Adds details, comment, updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Ambar Warrick

May 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open sharply

higher on Wednesday as investors clung to hopes of a recovery

from a coronavirus-fuelled slump amid signs of more stimulus for

ailing sectors, while retailer Lowe's jumped on upbeat quarterly

results.

The home improvement chain LOW.N rose 5.5% in premarket

trading after posting higher first-quarter same-store sales as

coronavirus lockdowns led people to spend more on home

remodelling and repairs. The U.S. stock market has now rallied more than 30% from

March lows on unprecedented stimulus, but gains have been

limited this month as traders digest mixed headlines on progress

in developing a coronavirus vaccine.

The S&P 500 tumbled 1% in the final hour of Tuesday's

session after a report raised doubts about positive results from

Moderna Inc's early-stage trial for a vaccine to

prevent against the respiratory disease.

""We don't expect very big gains from here but we don't

expect a downward trend either,"" said Simona Gambarini, markets

economist at Capital Economics in London.

""As the lockdowns are eased and the coronavirus epidemic is

brought under control in more and more countries, some recovery

in the economy is already factored into the equity prices.""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve

Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday the government and the

central bank were considering more measures to ensure the

worst-stricken areas of the economy received adequate support.

All eyes are now on minutes due later in the day from the

Fed's latest policy meeting where it maintained interest rates

near zero.

At 7:46 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMcv1 were up 279 points, or

1.15%, S&P 500 e-minis EScv1 were up 32 points, or 1.1% and

Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQcv1 were up 92.75 points, or 1%.

Target Corp TGT.N reported a 64% plunge in quarterly

profit, pummeled by costs to tackle the coronavirus outbreak,

but its shares rose on the back of a jump in online sales.

Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc , Apple

, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc

rose between 0.9% and 2.6%, while Bank of America Corp

BAC.N , Citigroup Inc C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N

gained about 2%.

Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N rose 3.1% after its chief

executive officer said he was confident travel will return in

the next 12 to 18 months. United Airlines Holdings

gained 3.5%. Immunotherapy company Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc

surged 23.3% after saying its experimental coronavirus vaccine

148,Apple Vs. Tesla: Morgan Stanley Breaks Down The Parallels,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-vs-tesla-morgan-stanley-172550031.html,2020-05-21 17:25:50+00:00,"Whether Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) should be valued as a car company or tech company is still up for debate in the investment community. But recent trends have sent Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas seeking advice from his Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) colleagues.

Apple's market cap sits just south of $1.4 trillion, while Tesla's cap is around $150 billion.

Apple Vs. Tesla

“As we close in on our 10th year of covering Tesla, we find fewer of our traditional automotive/consumer/industrials clients are looking at the name,” Jonas wrote in a note.

But its tech investors are all over it.

“They view Tesla in a way they viewed Apple 20 years ago — a company that thinks differently, that is incredibly innovative in a category that needs a spurt of innovation,” Katy Huberty told Jonas.

As she describes it, tech investors care less about current valuation than about fundamentals and scale and profitability prospects. For indications of future performance, they look partly to leadership.

“There are parallels to draw between AAPL under Steve Jobs and Tesla under Elon Musk,” Huberty said. “The question for Tesla from here is whether it also needs an operational leader, as Tim Cook is to Apple, in order to become a trillion dollar company.”

Challenges And Competition

While the company may boast some advantages under a founder, it also faces challenges.

“Importantly, there can be some very good years of innovation and hypergrowth... but then there’s a list of things that can become distraction and it's just as important to surround a founder with strong business leaders and provide visibility into a longer term succession plan,” Huberty said.

In the long run, she expects Apple to rise as a Tesla competitor rather than a partner. And with expected R&D spend of $19 billion in 2020, the consumer-device company is poised for disruption.

“I see the end game as a vertically integrated solution and don’t expect Apple to partner with a company that sells a competing product,” Huberty said.

149,U.S. Stock Market: (Still) Trying To Understand The Bulls,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4349200-u-s-stock-market-still-trying-to-understand-bulls,2020-05-21 08:39:46+00:00,"If your read my last article ""Trying To Understand The Bulls,"" which was published two days ago, you might have looked at the bullish arguments and confront me with the counterargument that there are much more reasons why the stock market will continue to climb higher. And you are absolutely right, and this is the reason why I am publishing this second article.

(Source: Pixabay)

In the last article, we looked at earnings estimates for 2020 and 2021, the comparison to China and why this current crisis won't just be a temporary hit leading to a quick V-shaped recovery. In the following article, I will look at the five biggest companies listed in the S&P 500 (SPY), which are expected to lead the index higher, the illusion that all facts are on the table, and of course, the actions of the Fed and the government. Similar to the last article, I will once again explain my own point of view and argue why the bulls are wrong. And finally, I will also look at two aspects that are usually missing in bullish articles, but are extremely important.

Argument 4: Tech Will Lead The Market Higher

As this article is intended to be the follow-up to my last article, this is the fourth bullish argument we are looking at. We are hearing and reading quite often that the strong performance of the tech sector (and the healthcare sector) and especially the performance of the five biggest companies which make up 21% of the S&P 500 and have been responsible for the rally not only in the last few weeks will lead to a higher S&P 500. When looking at those five big tech companies, only Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is lagging a bit behind as it is still down about 10% compared to February 20, 2020. And while Amazon (AMZN) is trading even 12% higher than before the crisis, the other three - Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) - are trading close to the levels before the crash.

Data by YCharts

The argument is pretty simple. Especially these five companies (as well as many other companies from the tech and/or healthcare sector) won't be affected much by the pandemic and the recession or might even profit and report higher revenue and higher earnings. But I am not so sure if this is true. Let's take a closer look.

It is certainly true that these five companies can take advantage of the lockdown and shelter-in-place orders. The cloud business of Microsoft and Amazon might profit. Facebook and Apple should profit when people spend more time on their iPhones and computers. Amazon will profit when retail stores are closed and people have to order online. But that is only true as long as the lockdown is in place. When people can go out again - and in several states many people are pushing hard to limit or suspend the restrictions - all these positive effects for the big tech companies might be gone again.

And the potential threats for these businesses are not only limited to the removal of the positive effects of shelter-in-place orders. Especially Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon are more or less dependent on revenue from advertisement (Alphabet about 80% and Facebook almost entirely), and while users might spend more time online, the revenue is actually coming from companies buying advertisement. With thousands of businesses being in trouble right now, we should expect revenue spending to decline. Especially small companies are important customers for Facebook and Alphabet - and these are often the businesses hit hard by the pandemic (I provided more information on Facebook and the impacts of declining advertisement in my recent Facebook article).

(Source: iab. Study)

More than 37 million people are without a job right now (and millions of people will be unemployed not only for a few weeks), the disposable income is declining leading to reduced spending. This could lead to lower revenue for Amazon (as the company is not only selling essential products) and especially for Apple (as the purchase of a new iPhone or iPad might be postponed in 2020). Summing up, I see several threats to the business model of these five companies and declining revenue is not impossible and also not unlikely.

Additionally, we have to look at the valuation of these companies. And I don't think all five are extremely overvalued, but valuation could also become a problem. Due to high growth expectations, these companies are usually ascribed high multiples, and while four of the five companies are still growing in the double digits, Apple's growth rates are not really impressive. But especially Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are currently trading at a much higher forward P/E ratio than the five-year average. And while Microsoft is actually reporting a higher growth rate than the five-year average, for Apple and Alphabet, growth has slowed down. And while Amazon can still grow at a high pace, the forward P/E still seems excessive.

Rev growth 5-year average Forward P/E 5-year average Microsoft 13.49% 7.86% 32.23 26.82 Apple 3.67% 7.25% 24.91 15.45 Amazon 22.66% 25.79% 126.43 180.26 Facebook 24.44% 43.40% 29.31 38.29 Alphabet 17.37% 19.68% 32.65 27.06

Earnings for 2020 and especially 2021 have only been revised downwards a little bit (10% at best), but if revenue and earnings are actually worse than expected and sentiment is changing, the assigned multiples might also decline. And the combination of actually declining earnings as well as lower ascribed multiples (not around 30 as right now, but maybe only 25 or 20) could easily lead to declines of 30%, 40% or even 50% for these stocks.

Argument 5: Big Corporations Lead To Stability

This argument goes hand in hand with the previous argument. The big corporations are much more stable and sometimes have a lot of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet (Alphabet, Facebook or Apple for example). And in times where liquidity is extremely important, cash on the balance sheet will provide stability. And even if these companies should not have enough cash reserves, they have easier access to capital.

I already argued above why I think the five big companies which led the S&P 500 higher in the last few weeks can also decline as their business models are not invincible and we might also see a changing sentiment ascribing these companies a lower valuation multiple.

We can also look at the past bear market during the years 2007 and 2009 and will see that the big corporations outperforming and ""stabilizing"" the index is not an untypical pattern. When looking at the 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500 (according to market capitalization in September 2008), 7 out of these 10 outperformed the S&P 500 in the first half of the crash (I draw the line on September 15, 2008, when Lehman failed because at that point the selloff intensified and the housing crisis became the final crisis leading to problems all over the world). Since the peak in September 2007, the S&P 500 declined about 24%. Only Exxon Mobil (XOM) declined similarly steep and reported a 20.96% decline. Chevron (CVX) declined 13.70% and Microsoft declined 10.90% and therefore saw a much softer decline till September 2008. IBM (IBM) declined only 2.63%, while Procter & Gamble (PG) could gain 1.49% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) increased even 5.07%. And finally, Walmart (WMT) could increase 36.32% during these 11 months.

Data by YCharts

We can also argue that these companies did keep the S&P 500 higher and counterbalanced the steeper decline of several other stocks. We usually have one or several industries that are affected hard at the beginning of the crisis (in 2007 it was basically every company associated with subprime mortgages, and in 2020, travel, restaurants and smaller retail stores were hit especially hard). The problems also often start with smaller companies and then spread slowly through the system. The big corporations are much more stable and can withstand difficult times much longer than smaller companies. In 2006 and 2007, the problem started with house owners who defaulted and couldn't pay interest on their mortgages anymore. And if you are arguing that small companies don't matter right now and won't threaten the economy, small house owners in 2007 should also not have been a problem, right? But at some point, this was threatening the whole economic world and affecting even huge corporations.

Data by YCharts

When looking at the performance of the seven companies we mentioned above after September 15, 2008, we still see an impressive outperformance in most cases, but many stocks fell 20% or 30% nevertheless (while the index was declining almost 50% from mid-September) and it was enough for the stock market to decline 56% during this bear market. In 2008 and 2009, the outperformance of the big corporations couldn't save the index and a decline of 20% or 30% for Facebook, Microsoft or Amazon is not impossible. So, don't bet on these five corporations to hold the stock market up. A strong performance in the beginning of a bear market is a pattern we also saw last time and it didn't prevent the stock market falling more than 50%.

Argument 6: All Facts Are On The Table

A sixth argument is indicating that the high levels of uncertainty we saw during February 2020 and March 2020 are gone now and all facts are on the table. It is true that market participants hate uncertainty and it is also true that we know way more now than two or three months ago. We know more about the virus; we know the reactions of the Fed as well as the government and we have quarterly results from most companies.

But there are so many unknowns: Medical and epidemiologic aspects like the question when we will find a vaccine or if we manage to contain the virus or if we will see a second or even third wave. Social and psychological aspects about the behavior of people and if they will respect social distancing rules. And of course, economic consequences like the effects of the lockdown on the economy (bankruptcies or credit defaults) or the consequences of more than 30 million people being unemployed remain unclear.

I will disagree with anybody who claims that we don't face uncertainties anymore. And I will also disagree with anybody who is claiming this crisis is different from past crisis because we already know the road ahead. To quote Cramer: ""They know nothing!"" Or a bit differently: ""We know nothing!"" When looking at the Financial Crisis and going back to the years 2007 or even 2006, the facts were also on the table and everybody should have been able to see what was about to happen. Subprime mortgage lending was leading to credit defaults, which was leading to problems for the banks lending the money and those betting on it and this led to banks collapsing. People losing their homes led to lower spending and massive financial problems for these people. Actually, quite simple - at least in hindsight - but almost nobody saw it coming.

Chose your side: either it is simple as all cards are on the table and we can see what is coming or it is difficult as many paths are possible, and although we can anticipate events and paths, the financial world is so complex it is almost impossible to predict what will happen exactly. But either way - it is the same in 2020 as it was during past recessions. And like it was obviously difficult to anticipate in 2007 what would follow in 2008 and 2009, it is difficult now.

Argument 7: Don't Fight The Fed

A last and final argument can be summarized in this one simple sentence: Don't fight the Fed! This is probably the strongest argument for a bullish scenario in my opinion. After the Fed already lowered the federal funds rate 50 basis points at the beginning of March 2020, it lowered the federal funds rate to zero on March 15, 2020. Additionally, the Fed started using several of its policy tools.

On March 17, 2020, the Fed established a Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. The same day, a Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was also established to support the credit needs of American households and businesses. Only one day later, on March 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve also established the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) to broaden the Fed's program of support for the flow of credit to households and businesses.

About one week later, the Federal Reserve also established the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) to support credit to employers through bond and loan issuances and will provide companies access to credit in order to maintain business operations. This facility is open to investment-grade companies (or those that were investment grade as of March 22, 2020). The Fed also established the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) to support credit to employers by providing liquidity to the market for outstanding corporate bonds. And the Fed established the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which will enable the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) backed by student loans, auto loans or credit card loans.

(Source: FRED)

Of course, buying assets has an impact on the balance sheet, and in the last few weeks, the balance sheet of the Fed (the total assets) increased from about $4.1 trillion before the crisis to $6,934 billion on May 13, 2020.

I have to admit that I don't know enough about monetary policy and I am not qualified enough to assess the decisions the Fed took in the past few weeks to offer a qualified opinion if this will be enough for the stock market to continue to climb higher. The Fed acted much faster than in 2008 (but the crisis also happened much faster and much more dramatic) and the different programs are much more extensive than in 2008, which obviously stabilized the markets. If it will be enough, I don't know that. But the Fed's actions are probably the strongest bullish argument right now.

Arguments We Don't Hear

So far, in this article as well as the last article, I looked at several arguments I constantly read in bullish articles. But aside from the bullish arguments we read all the time, we also have to point out what arguments and aspects are usually missing in bullish articles - and we will focus on two main points. First of all, we are looking at the current valuation, and we are also looking at COVID-19 itself.

It often seems as if bulls don't care at all for valuation aspects, but valuation is important and there are several different metrics you can use to measure the current stock market valuation. I only like to present two different points of view here. The first is a look at the 150-year history of the S&P 500. In an article, which was published during September 2018 called ""Even The Longest Bull Market Won't Last Forever,"" I wrote about several mistakes investors are making. One of them was the wrong time frame. While it seems like many investors won't even look at several years or maybe one or two different cycles (but only at the recent past), we probably look very seldom at the big picture (and I mean big picture). When looking at the P/E ratio during the last 150 years, we clearly see that valuation in the last 20 or 30 years was extremely high - compared to historic ""norms"" or average numbers. And while a CAPE ratio of 20 might seem rather cheap when looking at the last 20 years, it is not cheap when looking at the last 150 years.

(Source: Author's work originally published here)

But even when ""only"" looking at the last 20 years, we have to realize that current valuation levels are extremely high. In a recent article from FactSet, the author wrote:

What is driving the rise in the forward 12-month P/E ratio? On March 23, the forward 12- month P/E ratio was 13.1, as the price of the index hit its lowest value since 2016 at 2237.40. Since March 23, the price of the S&P 500 has increased by 28.8%, while the forward 12- month EPS estimate has decreased by 16.2%. Thus, the increase in the 'P' and the decrease in the 'E' have both been drivers of the sharp increase in the P/E ratio over the past seven weeks.

The following chart is demonstrating how high the valuation is right now by looking at the forward 12-month P/E ratio over the last 20 years. We are almost near the record valuation levels we saw during the Dotcom bubble.

(Source: FactSet)

Aside from valuations, there is a second important aspect that is usually missing in bullish articles. The bullish thesis is built on one very important aspect: The pandemic is over. We won't see rising cases again. We won't see lockdowns or shelter-in-place orders again and it was only the short episode since March 2020.

I honestly hope that countries all over the world will be able to contain or at least control the virus with only limited number of new infections every day (like in China for the past two months). But how can we know that and what makes bulls so confident? While many European countries seem to be in control of the situation right now, cases in the United States are still rather high. In the same time, we see cases still increasing exponentially in countries like Russia or Brazil. China will be testing all 11 million residents in Wuhan as it is afraid of a second wave and put Jilin on a similar lockdown as Wuhan in January. We still don't have a vaccine and many experts assume it will take at least till the end of 2020 or even longer. I am aware of the positive developments on trying to come up with a vaccine, but betting on the success of these companies seems similarly dangerous as betting on a bullish scenario for the overall stock market.

Conclusion

In total, I presented seven arguments for a bullish scenario and climbing stock prices in the near-term future. Aside from ""Don't fight the Fed,"" I don't see the other arguments as very convincing for further stock price increases. In my opinion, the market is currently priced for perfection: a scenario where most of the 37 million people unemployed right now will have a job again in a few weeks or months, earnings won't be affected for several quarters, but only in the second and maybe third quarters, and there won't be a second wave and a vaccine will be found in the foreseeable future. And I honestly can't image that happening!

152,U.S. strikes at a Huawei prize: chip juggernaut HiSilicon,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-chips-analysis-idUSKBN22X2T3,2020-05-22 11:42:40+00:00,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The latest U.S. government action against China’s Huawei takes direct aim at the company’s HiSilicon chip division — a business that in a few short years has become central to China’s ambitions in semiconductor technology but will now lose access to tools that are central to its success.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. flag and a smartphone with the Huawei and 5G network logo are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken January 29, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo

That could make it the most damaging U.S. attack yet against a Chinese company that U.S. officials told reporters Wednesday functioned as a “tool of strategic influence” for the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures “arbitrary and pernicious.”

Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.

But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei’s rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business.

HiSilicon’s Kirin smartphone processor is now considered to be on par with those created by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) —a rare example of an advanced Chinese semiconductor product that competes globally.

HiSilicon is also central to Huawei’s leadership in 5G, stepping into the breach when the United States cut off access to some U.S. chips last year.

In March, Huawei revealed that 8% of the 50,000 5G base stations it sold in 2019 came with no U.S. technology, using HiSilicon chipsets instead.

But the U.S. export control rule, first reported by Reuters last week, aims to block HiSilicon’s access to two crucial tools: chip design software from U.S. firms including Cadence Design Systems Inc (CDNS.O) and Synopsys Inc (SNPS.O), and the manufacturing prowess of “foundries,” led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), that build chips for many of the world’s top semiconductor firms.

With the new restrictions，HiSilicon “will be in a situation where they’re not able to manufacture chips at all, or if they do, then they’re not leading edge anymore,” says Stewart Randall, who tracks China’s chip industry at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.

Without its own processors, Huawei will lose its edge over domestic smartphone rivals, analysts said. International sales had already been gutted by a ban on the use of key Google software.

Industry sources say Huawei has stockpiled chips, and the new U.S. rule will not go into full force for 120 days. U.S. officials also note that licenses could be granted for some technologies. HiSilicon can also keep using design software it has already acquired.

HILSILICON IN TOUGH SPOT

Still, analysts agree HiSilicon is in a tough spot. Nearly all chip factories globally — including China’s leading foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK) — buy gear from the same equipment makers, led by U.S. firms Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O), Lam Research Corp (LRCX.O) and KLA Corp (KLAC.O).

The new U.S. rule requires licenses for companies using U.S. machinery to build Huawei-designed chips and delivered to the Chinese firm. To be sure, the new rule will not catch items shipped to a third party, allowing HiSilicon’s fabricators like TSMC the ability to ship chips to HiSilicon’s device manufacturers who can send them directly to a customer.

While there are alternatives to American machines - Japan’s Tokyo Electron Ltd (8035.T), for example, makes gear that competes with Applied Materials - replacing U.S. technology is not as simple as swapping out a machine.

“You almost have to think about it like a heart transplant,” said VLSI Research Chief Executive Dan Hutcheson, noting that chip production lines are finely calibrated systems where everything has to work well together.

Doug Fuller of the City University of Hong Kong said Huawei had a few options. It could slip around the rule by having suppliers ship directly to Huawei customers, though the U.S. officials said they would be vigilant about such workarounds.

Huawei and the Chinese government could re-double efforts to build production capabilities that did not require U.S. tools, by investing in nascent Chinese competitors and buying from Japanese and Korean firms, even if that required quality sacrifices.

Or Huawei could turn away from HiSilicon and revert to buying from overseas suppliers — just not American ones. “There’s talk of Huawei just turning to Samsung processors,” for its smartphone, said Fuller.

153,Work-from-home productivity pickup has tech CEOs predicting many employees will never come back to the office,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/work-from-home-productivity-gain-has-tech-ceos-predicting-many-workers-will-never-come-back-to-the-office-2020-05-15?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo,2020-05-15 00:00:00,"If you rebuild the workplace after COVID-19, will the workers ever come back?

In Silicon Valley, the answer from many tech companies is that many won’t, and maybe that’s a good thing.

In recent days, Twitter Inc. US:TWTR has said that employees have the option of never coming back to the office to work, while Facebook Inc. US:FB, Google parent Alphabet Inc. US:GOOGL US:GOOG, Salesforce.com Inc. US:CRM and Slack Technologies Inc. US:WORK have said they don’t expect workers back in the office until 2021 — if then.

That just may be the beginning: At least six prominent tech companies are considering permanently moving a large slice of their workforces to work-from-home status, their chief executives told MarketWatch this week.

“It’s hard to not see 20% to 40% of our workforce be remote,” Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield told MarketWatch in an interview Thursday on — appropriately enough — a Zoom US:ZM video call.

“We need to make real-estate decisions long in advance, two to three years, and are in the speculative conversation now if we have 30%, 40% fewer desks,” Butterfield said in discussing conversations he was having with fellow Slack executives this week. “We may make the office more of a hotel.”

Don’t miss: Companies reveal their plans for what work will look like when America returns to the office

The COVID-19 pandemic forcing those who could work from home to do so has led to a surprising result — improved productivity. U.S. workers were 47% more productive in March and April than in the same two months a year ago through cloud-based business tools, chat applications and email, according to an analysis of 100 million data points from 30,000 Americans by workplace-monitoring company Prodoscore.

“I was pretty wrong about this. I thought productivity was going to plunge, but it has been very good,” Okta Inc. CEO Todd McKinnon US:OKTA added, as the company considers a new dynamic work initiative. He said he could see Okta following Twitter’s path “until there is a vaccine or a treatment.”

As small businesses and nonessential services slowly begin to reopen, tech CEOs like Butterfield and McKinnon US:OKTA are in internal discussions about fundamental changes to their workforces with far-reaching social implications. Not only are they open to letting a majority of employees work remotely; they’re vastly scaling back travel and attendance at conferences, hiring talent from all parts of the country, reducing office space and using the office as a place to socialize as much as work.

The financial impact on cities like San Francisco and Seattle, where tech is the chief economic engine, could be devastating. Use of commercial real estate and public transit are likely to decline. Restaurants, bars and other gathering spots could be endangered. And then there is the toll on workers, many of whom feel increasingly isolated and stressed, worried about the security of their jobs even as they log long shifts at home.

But that is the collateral damage from a new workforce that could also save companies billions of dollars in operational costs; greatly reduce traffic and liability related to sick employees; and enhance productivity from a workforce that eats, sleeps and lives at its diffuse, de facto offices. Tech is uniquely positioned to take advantage of working conditions turned upside down and sideways because it has the technical resources to support a decentralized workforce, and a significant slice of its employees already worked remotely.

In a free-wheeling “virtual dinner” this week attended by five software CEOs — McKinnon, Box Inc.’s US:BOX Aaron Levie, PagerDuty Inc.’s US:PD Jennifer Tejada, Twilio Inc.’s US:TWLO Jeff Lawson and Zuora Inc.’s US:ZUO Tien Tzuo — the topic elicited the most animated conversation.

“Twitter will cause a snowball of other organizations going forward,” said Levie, who has weaned on the management style of former Intel Corp. US:INTC CEO Andy Grove, who weaved through offices to get an up-close look at workers. “We may not go back to work the same way [at Box]. Things are faster, more action-oriented with remote workers. With videoconferencing, I can check in on customers in the U.S., Japan and Europe in one day.”

“Our salespeople meet five to eight customers a day now [via videoconferencing] versus the one it took them three days [to see in the past] because of travel,” he added.

A major reason for improved productivity is that people have had little else to do during the shelter-at-home directive and felt pressure to produce to retain their jobs, countered Shane Metcalf, chief culture officer at 15Five, an enterprise technology company.

“One of the shadow side effects is that employees are working longer hours, and feel as if they’re always on call,” he said. “They are stressed.”

To be sure, not everyone will follow Twitter’s lead. Some, like Apple Inc. US:AAPL, Nvidia Corp. US:NVDA and Amazon.com Inc. US:AMZN, have devoted billions of dollars to sparkling new facilities that will always house thousands of employees. And some people want to return to an office, pointed out PagerDuty’s Tejada.

Added Butterfield: “Some employees are going insane [because they] are cooped up alone in an apartment or have kids and want to go back to work. The majority want to be in the office.”

“We don’t believe that ‘office-less globally’ is in our company’s best interest to build strong company culture or long-term productivity. Like most things in life, the best answer is typically something that moderates between two extremes,” Vonage Holdings Corp. US:VG CEO Alan Masarek told MarketWatch via email. None of the company’s 2,400 employees will be required to come back to the office “until they are comfortable doing so.”

Record traffic usage of Zoom, Microsoft Corp.’s US:MSFT Teams, Slack Technologies Inc.’s US:WORK enterprise messaging, Cisco Systems Inc.’s US:CSCO Webex and other services underscores the always-on workplace.

“Some elements of this work-from-home scenario will not go away,” Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday following the company’s quarterly earnings announcement. For example, Webex hosted more than 20 billion meeting minutes in April, compared with 14 billion in March and 7 billion in February.

“The pandemic has created a permanent shift in the way people are working, and while not every organization will go 100% work from home forever, there will certainly be more support for virtualized environments,” Masarek said.

One company going all-in virtually is Dialpad because, quite simply, it can. CEO Craig Walker, who helped develop Google Voice technology, was leaning that way before the pandemic forced most of the economy to shut down. He wants the communications-software firm’s 400 employees to work from home four or five days a week, he said, and he plans to halve office space to accommodate a staggered work schedule.

No matter what path companies take, they agree it will not be the same. Some employees will exclusively work from home, while others will opt for the office. And others may do both.

“It’s back to a whole new way of work — like back to the future,” says Quick Base CEO Ed Jennings, who took over the $1 billion, 500-person company this week, but has yet to visit headquarters.

Still, he’s already re-imagining what it will look like in the future — with more open space, partitions and collaboration spaces.

“It is hard to create depth of relationship when you communicate strictly via virtual meeting,” Jennings said. “Employees say these days they get things done so much faster at home. The question is whether that is sustainable.”"

[Click here to read what’s moving markets heading into Thursday, May 21]

Wall Street was poised to reverse Tuesday losses, which sent each of the Dow and S&P 500 off more than 1%. These declines came after a STAT News report late during the regular trading day questioned the significance of the data Moderna (MRNA) provided in assessing its experimental COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Tuesday’s dip in turn erased some of the gains made during a roaring session Monday, during which optimism over Moderna’s vaccine data had contributed in part to the advance.

“Investors after the initial waterfall decline have dissected and realized which stocks are going to be able to hold up better during this phase,” Ed Clissold, Ned Davis Research’s chief strategist, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.

He predicted a “massive rotation that you normally see at the beginning of a bull market” from the biggest names into other stocks that can outperform. “This rotation is going to happen once the economy really starts to open up,” he added.

Some more upbeat developments, however, continued to trickle in surrounding the pandemic. In the hard-hit state of New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in his daily briefing Wednesday that another 112 individuals lost their lives from the coronavirus as of Tuesday, with this marking the tenth straight day that the death toll came in below 200. New deaths in New York have come down significantly from the hundreds of new daily deaths recorded in early April.

Elsewhere, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced Tuesday afternoon that he was lifting mandatory stay in place orders and instead designating these measures as “strong recommendations,” albeit while keeping restaurants and some other businesses under stricter restrictions. Meanwhile, an earlier report from South Korean health officials suggested that individuals who tested positive for Covid-19 and recovered had a level of protection from reinfection and transmission.

But even as the health crisis appears to have eased by some measures in some areas, the economic distress induced by the crisis and social distancing measures remains on full display. New data Tuesday morning showed new U.S. housing starts and building permits fell to the lowest levels since early 2015 in April, signaling the far-reaching impact of the pandemic on activity across virtually all sectors of the economy.

And in congressional testimony Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was “the risk of permanent damage” if states take too long in reopening, thereby keeping an anchor on employment and business activity. Still, his baseline assumption is that economic conditions will improve in the third and fourth quarters of this year.

His testimony came alongside remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who said before the Senate Banking Committee he expects the Fed’s Main Street Lending Program aimed at providing loans to small- and medium-sized businesses will launch by the end of the month or first few days of June.

2:02 p.m. ET: Federal Reserve releases April meeting minutes, revealing some participants were considering ‘more explicit’ forward guidance

The Federal Reserve released the minutes for its April 28 through April 29 policy meeting, during which the central bank decided to hold benchmark interest rates near zero. The release Wednesday afternoon did not contribute to a meaningful initial market reaction across assets.

In the minutes, the central bank revealed that “some participants commented that the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit.”

“For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic outcomes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved before the Committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate,” it added.”

“The Committee could also consider date-based forward guidance that would indicate that the target range could be raised only after a specified amount of time had elapsed,” The Fed said in the minutes. “These participants noted that such explicit forms of forward guidance could help ensure that the public’s expectations regarding the future conduct of monetary policy continued to reflect the Committee’s intentions.”"
155,China’s Got a New Plan to Seize the World’s Tech Crown From the U.S.,https://ph.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chinas-got-a-new-plan-to-seize-the-worlds-tech-crown-from-the-us-199157,None,"© Reuters.

(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is accelerating its bid for global leadership in key technologies, planning to pump more than a trillion dollars into the economy through the rollout of everything from wireless networks to artificial intelligence.

In the masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China will invest an estimated $1.4 trillion over six years to 2025, calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. to lay fifth generation wireless networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software that will underpin autonomous driving to automated factories and mass surveillance.

The new infrastructure initiative is expected to drive mainly local giants from Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Huawei to SenseTime Group Ltd. at the expense of U.S. companies. As tech nationalism mounts, the investment drive will reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology, echoing objectives set forth previously in the Made in China 2025 program. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.

“Nothing like this has happened before, this is China’s gambit to win the global tech race,” said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. “Starting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.”

The tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China’s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country’s worst economic performance since the Mao era.

The nation’s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent (HK: ) Holdings (OTC: ) Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.

Maria Kwok’s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant’s payment is late.

China is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There’s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with “dumb” bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.

What BloombergNEF Says

China’s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens. One bet is on industrial internet-of-things platforms as China aims to cultivate three world leading companies in this area by 2025.

China isn’t alone in pumping money into the tech sector as a way to get out of the post-virus economic slump. Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its “New Deal” to create jobs and boost growth.

According to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail.

Separate estimates by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings (NASDAQ: ), Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.

Beijing’s half-formed vision is already stirring a plethora of stocks, a big reason why five of China’s 10 best-performing stocks this year are tech plays like networking gear maker Dawning Information Industry Co. and Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier GoerTek Inc. The bare outlines of the masterplan were enough to drive pundits toward everything from satellite operators to broadband providers.

It’s unlikely that U.S companies will benefit much from the tech-led stimulus and in some cases they stand to lose existing business. Earlier this year when the country’s largest telecom carrier China Mobile (NYSE: ) awarded contracts for 37 billion yuan in 5G base stations, the lion’s share went to Huawei and other Chinese companies. Sweden’s Ericsson (BS: ) got only a little over 10% of the business in the first four months. In one of its projects, Digital China will help the northeastern city of Changchun swap out American cloud computing staples IBM (NYSE: ), Oracle (NYSE: ) and EMC (NYSE: ) with home-grown technology.

It’s in data centers that a considerable chunk of the new infrastructure development will take place. Over 20 provinces have launched policies to support enterprises utilizing cloud computing services, according to a March note from UBS Group AG (NYSE: ). Tony Yu, chief executive officer of Chinese server maker H3C, that his company was seeing a significant increase in demand for data center services from some of the country’s top internet companies. “Rapid growth in up-and-coming sectors will bring a new force to China’s economy after the pandemic passes,” he told Bloomberg News.

From there, more investment should flow. Bain Capital-backed data center operator Chindata Group estimated that for every one dollar spent on data centers another $5 to $10 in investment in related sectors would take place, including in networking, power grid and advanced equipment manufacturing. “A whole host of supply-chain companies will benefit,” the company said in a statement.

There’s concern about whether this long-term strategy provides much in the way of stimulus now, and where the money will come from. “It’s impossible to prop up China’s economy with new infrastructure alone,” said Zhu Tian, professor of economics at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “If you are worried about the government’s added debt levels and their debt servicing abilities right now, of course you wouldn’t do it. But it’s a necessary thing to do at a time of crisis.”

Digital China is confident that follow-up projects from its housing initiative in Guangzhou could generate 30 million yuan in revenue for the company. It’s also hoping to replicate those efforts with local governments in the northeastern province of Jilin, where it has 3.3 billion yuan worth of projects approved. These include building a so-called city brain that will for the first time connect databases including traffic, schools and civil matters such as marriage registry. “The concept of smart cities has been touted for years but now we are finally seeing the investment,” said Kwok.

(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is accelerating its bid for global leadership in key technologies, planning to pump more than a trillion dollars into the economy through the rollout of everything from wireless networks to artificial intelligence.

In the masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China will invest an estimated $1.4 trillion over six years to 2025, calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. to lay fifth generation wireless networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software that will underpin autonomous driving to automated factories and mass surveillance.

The new infrastructure initiative is expected to drive mainly local giants from Alibaba (NYSE: ) and Huawei to SenseTime Group Ltd. at the expense of U.S. companies. As tech nationalism mounts, the investment drive will reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology, echoing objectives set forth previously in the Made in China 2025 program. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.

“Nothing like this has happened before, this is China’s gambit to win the global tech race,” said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. “Starting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.”

The tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China’s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country’s worst economic performance since the Mao era.

The nation’s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC: ) Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.

Maria Kwok’s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant’s payment is late.

China is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There’s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with “dumb” bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.

What BloombergNEF Says

China’s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens. One bet is on industrial internet-of-things platforms as China aims to cultivate three world leading companies in this area by 2025.

China isn’t alone in pumping money into the tech sector as a way to get out of the post-virus economic slump. Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its “New Deal” to create jobs and boost growth.

According to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail.

Separate estimates by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings (NASDAQ: ), Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.

Beijing’s half-formed vision is already stirring a plethora of stocks, a big reason why five of China’s 10 best-performing stocks this year are tech plays like networking gear maker Dawning Information Industry Co. and Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier GoerTek Inc. The bare outlines of the masterplan were enough to drive pundits toward everything from satellite operators to broadband providers.

It’s unlikely that U.S companies will benefit much from the tech-led stimulus and in some cases they stand to lose existing business. Earlier this year when the country’s largest telecom carrier China Mobile (NYSE: ) awarded contracts for 37 billion yuan in 5G base stations, the lion’s share went to Huawei and other Chinese companies. Sweden’s Ericsson (BS: ) got only a little over 10% of the business in the first four months. In one of its projects, Digital China will help the northeastern city of Changchun swap out American cloud computing staples IBM (NYSE: ), Oracle (NYSE: ) and EMC (NYSE: ) with home-grown technology.

It’s in data centers that a considerable chunk of the new infrastructure development will take place. Over 20 provinces have launched policies to support enterprises utilizing cloud computing services, according to a March note from UBS Group AG (NYSE: ). Tony Yu, chief executive officer of Chinese server maker H3C, that his company was seeing a significant increase in demand for data center services from some of the country’s top internet companies. “Rapid growth in up-and-coming sectors will bring a new force to China’s economy after the pandemic passes,” he told Bloomberg News.

From there, more investment should flow. Bain Capital-backed data center operator Chindata Group estimated that for every one dollar spent on data centers another $5 to $10 in investment in related sectors would take place, including in networking, power grid and advanced equipment manufacturing. “A whole host of supply-chain companies will benefit,” the company said in a statement.

There’s concern about whether this long-term strategy provides much in the way of stimulus now, and where the money will come from. “It’s impossible to prop up China’s economy with new infrastructure alone,” said Zhu Tian, professor of economics at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “If you are worried about the government’s added debt levels and their debt servicing abilities right now, of course you wouldn’t do it. But it’s a necessary thing to do at a time of crisis.”

Digital China is confident that follow-up projects from its housing initiative in Guangzhou could generate 30 million yuan in revenue for the company. It’s also hoping to replicate those efforts with local governments in the northeastern province of Jilin, where it has 3.3 billion yuan worth of projects approved. These include building a so-called city brain that will for the first time connect databases including traffic, schools and civil matters such as marriage registry. “The concept of smart cities has been touted for years but now we are finally seeing the investment,” said Kwok.

The broader markets remain volatile due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But the recent pullback gives investors with a long-term horizon an opportunity to create massive wealth. Investing in your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) should be a top priority. While contributions to this account are not tax deductible, any withdrawals in the form of capital gains or dividends are tax-free.

We know that the TFSA contribution limit for 2020 stands at $6,000 and the maximum limit is $69,500. For millennial couples who were eligible to contribute to the TFSA since it was introduced back in 2009, the maximum contribution limit stands at $139,500.

The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be a near-term headwind, which means markets should rebound once the dreaded virus is brought under control. It is important to bet on the Canadian and U.S. economies given that they have survived multiple past recessions.

Investment mogul Warren Buffett famously stated, “In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”

So where do you invest this money in a market that is fluctuating wildly?

Growth stocks for your TFSA

Growth stocks have generated staggering returns in the past. These companies increase revenue and earnings at a far greater pace than the overall market. A solid growth rate ensures that such companies are valued at a premium, which means they tend to outperform broader markets over time.

For example, tech heavyweights such as Apple, Netflix, and Amazon have returned 793%, 1,880%, and 3,005% respectively in the last decade. This means a $1,000 investment each in these companies would be worth a cumulative $56,735 today.

While there are tons of growth stocks south of the border such as Lululemon Athletica, Okta, and Zoom, you can look at Canada’s homegrown giants as well.

Shopify (TSX:SHOP)(NYSE:SHOP) has crushed market returns since it went public in May 2015. As we can see in the above chart, Shopify has easily outperformed Apple, Netflix, and Amazon since its IPO and has returned close to 3,000% in five years.

Shopify stock is trading on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $753; it recently surpassed the $1,000 mark on the TSX. This stupendous growth has driven Shopify’s stock to sky-high valuations, and it’s now valued at US$80.9 billion, or a whopping 40 times its 2020 sales. While investors are rightly concerned over its nosebleed multiples, Shopify remains a top bet for the upcoming decade.

As people are largely confined to their houses, the shift to online shopping has accelerated. Shopify is already the second-largest e-commerce platform in the United States behind Amazon. It is well poised to grow market share in the e-commerce segment and is outpacing several peers.

The Foolish takeaway

Shopify stock should be bought at every major price correction. It holds the potential to be Canada’s first trillion-dollar company given its growth trends and an expanding addressable market.

Shopify is but one example of a quality growth stock for your TFSA. You need to create a robust portfolio of such companies with the potential to generate exponential returns in the upcoming decade.

163,Netflix Stock Called Long-Term Winner,https://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/netflix-stock-called-long-term-winner/,2020-05-22 20:14:40+00:00,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) has seen its stock fall from an all-time high recently as bears and bulls debate its valuation. But a new bull to Netflix stock says skeptics underappreciate the company's long-term positioning.

X

On Friday, Jefferies analyst Alex Giaimo reiterated his buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of 520. He initiated coverage of Netflix on May 14.

On the stock market today, Netflix stock dropped 1.6% to 429.32. On Tuesday, it notched a record high of 458.97.

During the coronavirus stock market crash, Netflix stock tumbled 26% to 290.25 on March 17 before beginning its rebound. On April 13, it broke out of a six-week cup base at a buy point of 393.62, according a weekly chart on IBD MarketSmith.

Netflix Stock Sentiment Leans Positive

""Stock sentiment leans more positive, with bulls highlighting the accelerated shift from linear to OTT (over-the-top TV) while bears push back on valuation and technicals,"" Giaimo said in a note to clients. ""Near-term choppiness is expected, but we advise buying dips and owning shares long term.""

Netflix is in ""land-grab mode"" as it bulks up its base of subscribers worldwide, Giaimo said. It is spending heavily on content to gain an advantage over streaming video rivals.

""At some point in the future, OTT will evolve into a mature competitive marketplace, at which point margin scrutiny will make more sense,"" he said. Netflix is in control of its free-cash-flow situation and will ""pull that lever when it needs to,"" Giaimo said.

Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic is speeding the shift from traditional television to video-on-demand, Giaimo said.

""Linear competition is hurting, and the lack of sports is resulting in significant advertising pressure,"" he said. ""The media paradigm has shifted.""

New Competition Coming Soon

Netflix ended the first quarter with 182.86 million subscribers worldwide, up 15.77 million from the end of 2019. The gains came despite stiff competition from new services such as Walt Disney's (DIS) Disney+ and Apple's (AAPL) Apple TV+.

Up next is the debut on Wednesday of HBO Max from AT&T's (T) WarnerMedia unit. On July 15, Comcast (CMCSA)-owned NBCUniversal officially will launch its Peacock streaming video service.

Netflix's hit original content recently has included shows such as ""Dead To Me,"" ""Love Is Blind,"" ""Outer Banks"" and ""Ozark.""

Netflix stock ranks fifth on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. It also is on the IBD Leaderboard watchlist.

165,"Greeley population surpasses Boulder’s, which declines for third consecutive year",https://www.greeleytribune.com/news/greeley-population-surpasses-boulders-which-declines-for-third-consecutive-year/,2020-05-21 07:59:19+00:00,"Greeley’s population increased to 108,649 in 2019, surpassing Boulder as that city marked its third consecutive year of population decline.

That’s according to the latest 2019 population estimates released at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The estimates are as of July 1, 2019.

Greeley’s population increased 1.1% from the previous year, buoyed by new residential developments and — until recently — strong energy and agribusiness sectors.

Roy Otto, Greeley city manager, said the city’s staff estimates that Greeley’s population actually surpassed 110,000 this year. He said the 1.1% growth rate is slower than what the city had seen in recent years, which he pegged at about 2% on average annually.

He expressed surprise that Greeley has surpassed Boulder in population, but noted that lower housing prices and cost of living have helped drive the city’s growth.

Greeley now ranks as the state’s 11th largest city, behind Denver, Colorado Springs, Aurora, Fort Collins, Lakewood, Thornton, Arvada, Westminster, Pueblo and Centennial. Boulder ranks as the state’s 12th largest city.

Otto said it’s unclear what effect the current economic downturn will have on Greeley’s population growth. The energy sector, for example, is weathering low prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a global price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia from March to mid-April..

“It’s hard to predict,” he said, noting that Greeley’s economy increasingly is tied to other communities in Northern Colorado, as Larimer and Weld counties embrace a common economic-development strategy.

Rich Werner, CEO of Upstate Colorado Economic Development, noted that his organization and other eco-devo groups soon will unveil targeted industry clusters for the region, identifying areas of strength for different communities.

Population-decline

“Economic situation notwithstanding, we’ve seen continued growth in Greeley and the region fueled by growth in the economy, as well as the [lower] cost of living,” Werner said. “If you look at the average home price in Boulder versus Greeley, you are afforded a greater and larger variety of housing.”

Werner said current economic conditions have displaced a significant number of workers in the energy sector, as well as in food services, retail and other industries.

“Particularly to the oil and gas industry, you’re going to have some pretty difficult short-term effects,” he said.

Greeley’s population growth in recent years contributes to opportunities for residents, he said.

“When you take the population numbers along with household income and see that continually increasing, that creates buying power that affords communities more opportunities in retail, commercial and entertainment type development,” he said. “That generates sales-tax revenue, which then allows communities to invest in more infrastructure.”

But he said “diversification of industries in Greeley and the region is paramount, especially in times like this.

“Having that diversification allows for a commodity-based economy, which Weld is, when you have ag, food processing and oil and gas … you’re going to see those fluctuations in price, which cause fluctuations in the economy,” he said. “Having that diversification allows for a greater resiliency.”

Boulder’s three years of decline

As Greeley continued its growth from July 2018 to July 2019, Boulder recorded its third year of population decline, losing 335 residents in that periodBoulder’s population has declined by 1,455 since 2016.

Boulder mayor Sam Weaver said the aging of the city’s population, as well as an expensive housing market, have contributed to the trend, as older individuals are more likely to be able to afford the city’s higher-priced housing.

“When a population is aging, you have fewer young people in the home, so that could be one factor,” he said. “As we get older and people retire and their kids move away, that’s one way you get population decrease.”

He noted that some mixed-use projects are beginning to come online in the city, such as the S’park development near 30th Street and Valmont Road, and The Rêve and Boulder Junction projects at 30th and Pearl streets.

“Obviously, we’re not building a ton of new units in Boulder,” he said. “We’re building some. I think as those mixed-use developments continue to come online … we might see those [population] numbers stabilize or reverse because people who are going to move into those mixed-use developments are going to be younger, typically.”

He said developers of those projects target a demographic that would include employees of expanding technology companies such as Google (Nasdaq: GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL).

“I would guess, with what we see coming, as long as COVID doesn’t disrupt it significantly, I expect us to stabilize or grow slightly with the new housing units we’re bringing online,” he said.

He said that Boulder includes many areas that could support additional housing, including shopping centers such as Diagonal Plaza between 28th and 30th streets along the Diagonal Highway.

“There’s a lot of poorly used space in Boulder that could accommodate more people,” he said, mentioning the Alpine-Balsam area (the former Boulder Community Hospital) and Diagonal Plaza.

“There’s an ocean of parking that’s hardly used at all out there,” he said. “Our shopping centers have the potential to redevelop in a way that promotes mixed-use,” with housing added to some locations.

John Tayer, CEO of the Boulder Chamber, agreed with Weaver that Boulder’s population decline could be attributed to high housing costs and an aging population.

“To me, it speaks to the imperative that we continue to provide opportunities for more residential development that is attainable by the full spectrum of our workforce so that we can provide housing for a wider variety of individuals,” he said. “While it’s true that there are some exciting new redevelopment projects occurring, we as the Boulder Chamber are going to continue to advocate for the exploration of redevelopment opportunities in underutilized areas of our community that would create wonderful, vibrant, mixed-use subcommunities.”

He said that with three years of population decline, “It’s fair to assume that we’re seeing that aging of the population and that there are fewer young residents and families that are able to afford Boulder.”

Population

Among other cities in the Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado:

• Berthoud continued its torrid growth pace, recording one-year growth of 15.5%, with the population reaching 9,094. The town’s population has increased 45% since 2016, propelled by new housing developments and proximity to other communities in Northern Colorado and the Boulder Valley.

• Fort Collins’ population reached 170,243, up 1.1% from July 2018. Fort Collins ranks as the state’s fourth largest city, behind Denver, Colorado Springs and Aurora.

• Louisville lost population for the second year in a row, dropping to 20,816 from a high of 21,185 in 2017.

• Longmont is just shy of the 100,000 population threshold at 97,261.

• Loveland’s population stands at 78,877, with a growth rate of 1.4% from 2018 to 2019.

• Westminster lost a few dozen residents between 2018 and 2019, with the population at 113,166, compared with 113,227 the year before.

• Superior also lost a small number of residents, with a population of 13,087, compared with 13,170 in 2018.

• Broomfield’s population increased by 1.6%, reaching 70,465, up from 69,324.

On Wednesday morning stocks are continuing their rebound rally. Less than an hour into the trading day, the Dow shot up 400 points, or 1.7%.

CNN reports that the S&P 500 was up 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.9%.

The stock rally doesn't have a particular driver today, but the reopening of the economy continues to fuel investor optimism in spite of worries about a second wave of infections.

The companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.

Many governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven’t been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people’s location, which Apple AAPL, +0.64% and Alphabet’s GOOGL, +0.46% GOOG, +0.54% Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.

Public health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants’ privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.

The companies said they’re not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic “exposure notification” system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren’t yet showing symptoms.

The identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.

“User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,” the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.

The companies said the new technology — the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants — solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone’s battery.

The statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.

“We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,” said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.

North Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.

Tim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota’s app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps — his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.

Some privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security. But others, including Ryan Calo, a law professor who co-directs the University of Washington’s Tech Policy Lab, said he is concerned about its effectiveness if people get too many false alerts asking them to quarantine themselves. He said public health agencies would be better off being able to track location with careful safeguards.

Calo said Google and Apple have been more upfront about the limitations of their model, but he said he’s still worried some governments will treat it as a substitute for crucial investments in free, widespread testing and hiring an army of human contact tracers.

“We’re just not going to get out of this global pandemic with a clever app,” he said."
168,"Google, Apple Roll Out Coronavirus Contact Tracing Technology",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-apple-roll-coronavirus-contact-112610555.html,2020-05-21 11:26:10+00:00,"Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) are rolling out their joint contact-tracing software technology targeted to help public health authorities control and slowdown the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

About 22 countries and several U.S. states are planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software, the two companies said in a joint statement. The initial version of the technology, which alerts users if they have come into contact with a Covid-19 infected individual, is available to public health agencies for both iOS and Android smartphones. Public health agencies will incorporate the API technology into their own apps that people install.

“Technology can help health officials rapidly tell someone they may have been exposed to COVID-19,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a Twitter post. “The Exposure Notification API we created with Google is available to help public health agencies make their COVID-19 apps effective while protecting user privacy.”

The rare collaboration between the two rival tech giants uses bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. They emphasized that the system does not collect or use location from the device.

“If a person is diagnosed with Covid-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app,” the two companies said in the joint statement.

For the technology to be effective, smartphone users must voluntarily opt into the system and add to their public health app if they test positive for Covid-19.

Looking at the digital giants’ ratings, TipRanks data shows that the consensus of Wall Street analysts view both Alphabet’s Google and Apple as Strong Buy stocks. Alphabet’s $1,488.09 average price target implies 5.6% upside potential in the coming year.

Following Apple’s 29% stock rally in the past two months, the $317.92 average price target by analysts indicates 0.4% downside potential in the next 12 months.

169,The Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio: All 47 Buffett Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-portfolio-48-buffett-200841242.html,2020-05-18 14:25:32+00:00,"Getty Images

When folks think of the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) portfolio and its collection of holdings, most of which were selected by Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, the companies that most readily come to mind are probably American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and, more recently, Apple (AAPL).

But a deep dive into Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings reveals a more complicated picture.

Berkshire Hathaway held positions in 47 separate stocks as of June 30, according to the most recent regulatory filing (Aug. 14) with the Securities and Exchange Commission - down from 48 in Q1 of this year, as he dumped USG Corp. (USG). But the portfolio of ""Buffett stocks"" isn't as diversified as the number might suggest. In some cases, BRK.B holds more than one share class in the same company. Some holdings are so small as to be immaterial leftovers from earlier bets the Oracle of Omaha has yet to completely exit.

And perhaps most importantly, Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio is actually pretty concentrated. The top six holdings account for almost 70% of the portfolio's total value. The top 10 positions comprise 80%. Banks and airlines, to cite a couple of sectors, carry quite a load in this portfolio. Then there's the fact that several Buffett stocks actually were picked by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

Here, we examine each and every holding to give investors a better understanding of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.

Shares held: 59,400

Holding value: $6,134,000

United Parcel Service (UPS, $113.90) might be the world's biggest package delivery company, but it's immaterial when it comes to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. With fewer than 60,000 shares, this is the most meager of Buffett stocks - a rump position, leftovers, an odd lot.

Buffett first invested in UPS in the first quarter of 2006, when he picked up 1.43 million shares worth about $113.5 million. That comes to an average price per share of $79.38.

UPS never was a major part of Berkshire's portfolio, and Buffett has pared the position over the years to where it wouldn't be a surprise if he exited the stake at any time. (Berkshire recently dropped another small holding - telecom giant Verizon (VZ) - in the first quarter of 2019 when he dumped his last 928 shares.)

Although Buffett occasionally can be fairly chatty about some of his more notable stock picks, he typically doesn't comment on BRK.B's buys and sells. There's no mention of United Parcel Service in CNBC's indispensable Warren Buffett archive. But one clue as to why UPS never became a bigger part of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings might be the fact that since March 31, 2006, it has delivered a total return of 110%. But Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generated a total return of 187% in that same time frame.

Translation: UPS has been a bust for BRK.B.

Berkshire Hathaway's Mondelez (MDLZ, $53.78) holding stems from Buffett's 2007 investment in what was then known as Kraft Foods. The packaged food company changed its name to Mondelez in 2012 after spinning off its North American grocery business, which was called Kraft Foods Group and traded under the ticker KRFT. In 2015, in a deal backed by Buffett, KRFT merged with H.J. Heinz to form Kraft Heinz (KHC).

As we'll see shortly, Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in KHC. As for Mondelez? Not so much. Shares in MDLZ, whose brands include Oreo cookies and Triscuit crackers, have underperformed vs. the S&P 500 since the spinoff.

It doesn't sound like Buffett is all that enamored with MDLZ, either. In 2017, he shot down speculation that Kraft Heinz would buy the global snacks giant.

Berkshire Hathaway owns just 0.04% of Mondelez shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. MDLZ accounts for only 0.01% of the total value of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio. Nothing to see here, folks.

Shares held: 315,400

Holding value: $34,584,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.02%

Procter & Gamble (PG, $117.39), the consumer products giant and component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is another blue-chip stock that has fallen by the wayside as a Berkshire Hathaway investment.

Buffett came to own P&G - maker of Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers - by dint of the company's 2005 acquisition of razor-maker Gillette. At the time, Buffett, a major Gillette shareholder, called the tie-up a ""dream deal."" P&G became one of BRK.B's biggest equity positions.

That dream didn't last very long. The Great Recession eroded the pricing power of old-line consumer staples companies such as P&G. The company embarked on a plan to shed 100 underperforming brands. The Duracell battery business happened to be on the list, and Berkshire bought it in 2014 in exchange for PG stock. Two years later, Buffett pared what was left of the P&G stake by 99%.

Don't be surprised if Buffett dumps the remaining shares any time now. He's basically out.

Shares held: 327,100

Holding value: $45,558,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.02%

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $130.54), like P&G, is another defensive Dow stock that has fallen out of favor with Buffett. (Kraft Foods, incidentally, also was a Dow stock for a time, from 2008 to 2012.) BRK.B's interest peaked more than a decade ago. Now, the diversified health-care giant represents nothing more than a token holding.

You can blame management missteps. J&J struggled with manufacturing problems and allegations of illegal marketing practices in 2010 and 2011. Buffett was critical of the company for those gaffes, as well as for using too much of its own stock in its 2011 acquisition of device-maker Synthes. Disenchanted with Johnson & Johnson, Buffett dumped most of Berkshire's stake in 2012.

Berkshire's position in JNJ topped out at 64.3 million shares in 2007. Today, the holding company's equity stake comes to just 327,100 shares (about $46 million), which represents less than 0.02% of shares outstanding. Thus, Johnson & Johnson could disappear from the ranks of the Buffett stocks in the near future.

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 2,714,854 / 1,284,020

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $46,777,000 / $22,072,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.03%

Liberty Latin America Class A (LILA, $15.48) and Liberty Latin America Class C (LILAK, $15.55) shares are just the first of several examples of BRK.B essentially betting on legendary pay-TV mogul John Malone.

Liberty Latin America provides cable, broadband, telephone and wireless services in Chile, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America. Liberty Global (LBTYA), the multinational telecommunications company in which Berkshire also holds a stake, issued tracking stock of its Latin American operations in 2015, then spun off those operations entirely in 2018.

As we'll see below, Berkshire has several other investments in Malone-backed enterprises. Malone, a pioneer in the telecom industry and a multibillionaire himself, has created outsize value for shareholders over his long career.

Whether the various investments are Buffett's ideas of those of his portfolio managers, the appeal is plain to understand: Game knows game.

39. Suncor Energy

Shares held: 10,758,000

Holding value: $335,219,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.16%

Warren Buffett made a move in the energy sector by initiating a position in Suncor Energy (SU, $27.61) in the fourth quarter of 2018. And it's a rarity among Buffett stocks, as it's not U.S.-based.

If this bet on Canada's biggest oil and gas company sounds familiar, it should: This is the second time Berkshire Hathaway has taken a stab at Suncor. The company originally invested in the energy giant in 2013, then sold the entirety of the position three years later. Suncor - an integrated energy giant whose operations span oil sands developments, offshore oil production, biofuels and even wind energy - also sells its refined fuel via a network of more than 1,500 Petro-Canada stations.

Berkshire's stake amounts to just 0.16% of Suncor's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway's only other investment in the energy sector is its position in oil and gas refiner and marketer Phillips 66.

Suncor also is a member of the Canadian Dividend Aristocrats by virtue of having raised its annual dividend payouts for 17 consecutive years.

38. Teva Pharmaceutical

Shares held: 43,249,295

Holding value: $399,191,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.19%

When Berkshire Hathaway revealed it took a stake in Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA, $6.16) in the fourth quarter of 2017, it looked like a classic Warren Buffett value move.

The Israel-based drug manufacturer was out of favor - to put it mildly. A bloated balance sheet, mass layoffs and the looming expiration of drug patents had short sellers licking their chops.

By the time Buffett stepped in, Teva shares were off about 70% from their mid-2015 peak. Berkshire then doubled his stake in Teva during the first quarter of 2018, when shares looked really cheap.

They look even cheaper now. Teva, which has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the start of Q2 2018, trades at just a bit more than 2.5 times analysts' estimates for future earnings - a fraction of the S&P 500's forward P/E. Meanwhile, BRK.B owns 4.3% of Teva's shares outstanding.

37. StoneCo





Shares held: 14,166,748

Holding value: $419,052,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.20%

Berkshire Hathaway announced in October 2018 that it would take a stake in StoneCo (STNE, $30.52) as the Brazilian financial technology company went public. Given the relatively small position in STNE, and the fact that it's a fintech company, it should come as no surprise that the position was initiated by Buffett lieutenant Todd Combs - with the Oracle of Omaha's blessing, no doubt.

StoneCo, which provides software and hardware for companies to facilitate credit- and debit-card payments, reported a 69% jump in year-over-year second-quarter revenue to 586.2 million Brazilian reals, or $145.1 million, which topped Wall Street estimates. Adjusted net income soared 172% year-over-year to 194.0 million reals, or $48 million.

StoneCo fits well with Berkshire Hathaway's general bullishness on companies that facilitate and process payments. ""Payments are a huge deal worldwide,"" Warren Buffett said at Berkshire's 2018 shareholder meeting.

Shares held: 5,552,715

Holding value: $519,401,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.25%

After Suncor, Phillips 66 (PSX, $97.47) is Berkshire Hathaway's only other investment in the energy sector. Buffett first bought shares in the oil and gas company in 2012. But despite having heaped praise on PSX in the past, Buffett has dramatically reduced his stake over the past year.

In the first quarter of 2018, he sold a whopping 35 million shares, reducing BRK.B's stake by more than 40%. However, that move was simply made to avoid regulatory headaches. Indeed, the purchaser of the shares was none other than PSX.

As Buffett said at the time: ""Phillips 66 is a great company with a diversified downstream portfolio and a strong management team. This transaction was solely motivated by our desire to eliminate the regulatory requirements that come with ownership levels above 10%.""

The thing is, Buffett continues to burn off Berkshire Hathaway's PSX holdings. Even after the big sale back to PSX in the Q1 2018, BRK.B remained the company's largest shareholder with 9.8% of all shares outstanding. But Buffett kept selling. In the first quarter of 2019 alone, he pared Berkshire's stake by another 53%. Berkshire now owns just 1.2% of Phillips 66's shares outstanding. Buffett has been characteristically mum on his reasons for the sales.

Shares held: 6,353,727

Holding value: $568,405,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.27%

Torchmark is a small holding for Berkshire Hathaway but a natural one. After all, it's a life and health insurance company, and various wholly owned insurance firms form the core of BRK.B's holdings.

Berkshire Hathaway has owned shares in Torchmark since early 2001, and while it's a boring company, it has quietly been a very good stock pick. Including dividends, TMK has generated an annualized return of 10.5% since March 30, 2001.

Just note that this longtime holding just got a little bit of a facelift. Effective Aug. 8, it is now called Globe Life (GL, $85.81), which should be reflected in Berkshire's third-quarter 13F.

BRK.B owns 5.8% of Torchmark's (now Globelife's) shares outstanding, which makes it the firm's third-largest shareholder after Vanguard and BlackRock (BLK).

Shares held: 8,438,225

Holding value: $586,794,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.28%

Investors may be forgiven if they're unfamiliar with Restaurant Brands International (QSR, $73.58). After all, it's a pretty bland name.

But there's no doubt they know the Canadian company's fast-food chains.

QSR was formed by the 2014 merger of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Three years later, the company acquired Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, making it the world's fifth-largest operator of fast food restaurants.

So where does Warren Buffett come in? Berkshire Hathaway helped fund Burger King's acquisition of Tim Hortons by purchasing a combination of preferred shares and warrants. In a classic Buffett move, he was able to finagle a 9% yield from the preferred shares. QSR redeemed the preferreds in 2017, adding to Berkshire's cash pile.

BRK.B still owns 3.3% of the fast-food company's shares outstanding, making it QSR's eighth-largest investor.

33. Store Capital

Shares held: 18,621,674

Holding value: $618,053,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.30%

It was notable when Buffett revealed Berkshire's position in Store Capital (STOR, $36.22) in the summer of 2017. Prior to Store, real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a way to invest in real estate without owning the actual assets - were never big among Buffett stocks.

In Store's case, it invests in single-tenant properties including chain restaurants, supermarkets, drugstores and other retail, service and distribution facilities. That's to say, Store is a bet on brick-and-mortar retail, which is thought to be in permanent decline.

Buffett, however, spied value - and he spied it for quite some time. Store Capital CEO Christopher Volk told CNBC that Buffett studied the REIT for three years before taking the plunge.

Berkshire Hathaway owns 18.6 million shares, which yielded 3.6% as of Aug. 15. With a stake of 8.2%, it is Store Capital's second-largest shareholder after Vanguard.

Shares held: 20,803,000

Holding value: $721,240,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.35%

Synchrony Financial (SYF, $32.76) jibes with Buffett's affection for credit-card companies and banks. Synchrony, a major issuer of charge cards for retailers, was spun off of GE Capital in 2014. It's both a lender and a payments processor - like Buffett's beloved American Express (AXP) - but it caters to customers who skew more toward the middle and lower end of the income scale.

Berkshire initiated a position in SYF during the second quarter of 2017, paying an estimated price per share of $30.02. Since the end of Q2 2017, the stock has delivered a total return of 15.7%.

BRK.B owns 3% of Synchrony Financial's shares outstanding, which makes it the firm's seventh-largest shareholder.

31. Axalta Coating Systems

Getty Images





Shares held: 24,264,000

Holding value: $722,339,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.35%

Axalta Coating Systems (AXTA, $27.52), which makes industrial coatings and paints for building facades, pipelines and cars, is the belle of the ball when it comes to mergers and acquisitions suitors. The company has rejected more than one buyout bid in the past, and analysts note that it's a perfect target for numerous global coatings companies.

Berkshire Hathaway got involved in 2015, when it purchased 20 million shares in AXTA from private equity firm Carlyle Group (CG). The stake makes sense given that Buffett is a long-time fan of the paint industry; Berkshire Hathaway bought house-paint maker Benjamin Moore in 2000.

Berkshire is Axalta's largest investor, holding 10.3% of the shares outstanding.

30. Liberty Global

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 19,791,000 / 7,346,968

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $534,159,000 / $194,915,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.35%

As noted above with Liberty Latin America, Liberty Global Class A (LBTYA, $26.03) and Liberty Global Class C (LBTYK, $25.73) are part of a spectrum of Berkshire Hathaway holdings in communications and media companies whipped up by billionaire dealmaker John Malone.

Liberty Global bills itself as the world's largest international TV and broadband company, with operations in 10 European countries. Berkshire's investment in the Class A shares dates to the fourth quarter of 2013. It picked up the Class C shares, which have no voting power, in the first quarter of 2014.

Between the Class A and Class C shares, Berkshire Hathaway owns a 3.7% stake in Liberty Global, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. And the holding company is Liberty's fifth-largest shareholder.

29. Sirius XM

Getty Images





Shares held: 137,915,729

Holding value: $769,570,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.37%

Sirius XM (SIRI, $5.97) - a company that reaches more than 100 million listeners via its core satellite radio business and Pandora, which it acquired in 2018 - is another stock pick related to John Malone. Malone is chairman of Liberty Media, which owns a massive stake in Sirius XM.

As Kiplinger has noted, it's possible that all of Berkshire's investments in companies that are somehow tied to Malone's truly Byzantine corporate structure could very well be the responsibility of one of Buffett's portfolio managers. Liberty Media was a large position held by Ted Weschler's Peninsula Capital in his pre-Berkshire days.

Berkshire first bought shares in SIRI during the final quarter of 2016. Berkshire's 3.1% stake in the company makes it Sirius XM's second-largest shareholder after Liberty Media, which owns almost 69% of the shares outstanding.

28. Travelers

Getty Images





Shares held: 5,958,391

Holding value: $890,899,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.43%

Few Buffett stocks are such natural fits as Travelers (TRV, $145.59), the blue-chip insurance giant. Insurance, after all, is the holding company's core business. In addition to TRV, Berkshire Hathaway has a stake in insurer Torchmark/Globe Life and counts numerous insurer companies as wholly owned subsidiaries. Geico, General Re and United States Liability Insurance Group are just three companies BRK.B owns as part of its sprawling insurance empire.

And Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a modest dividend yield of 2.3%, has the kind of pedigree and income stream Buffett favors.

Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in Travelers in the third quarter of 2018, then boosted its stake by 68% in the fourth quarter. BRK.B now holds almost 6 million shares in TRV.

At less than $1 billion, the stake is relatively small beer for Berkshire Hathaway, but it's a big deal to Travelers. Buffett's holding company is Travelers' seventh-largest shareholder, owning 2.3% of all shares outstanding.

27. M&T Bank

Getty Images





Shares held: 5,382,040

Holding value: $915,324,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.44%

As we shall see, Warren Buffett has been initiating positions in several bank stocks over the past few quarters, but he's been a fan of M&T Bank (MTB, $144.67) for a very long time. Indeed, MTB has been a member in good standing of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio since 2001.

The regional bank operates more than 750 branches in eight states, including New York, Maryland and New Jersey, as well as Washington, D.C., and it has been profitable year after year for decades. It also has been a reliable dividend payer. Buffett has a soft spot for well-run, unassuming businesses. And he frequently cites the importance of management talent when it comes to deciding where to invest. He certainly was a fan of M&T Bank's late CEO.

In 2011, Buffett recommended that Berkshire Hathaway shareholders read M&T's annual reports, which were written by Robert Williams, chairman and CEO from 1983 until his death in 2017. ""Bob is a very smart guy and he has a lot of good observations,"" Buffett said.

Although M&T Bank represents a small portion of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio, BRK.B is a big holder of MTB. With 3.9% of shares outstanding, Berkshire is the bank's seventh-largest shareholder.

26. Red Hat

Shares held: 5,171,890

Holding value: $971,074,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.47%

In another investment most likely made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, Berkshire Hathaway first took a stake in Red Hat in the fourth quarter of 2018. Buffett himself tends to shy away from technology stocks such as Red Hat, which is an open-source software company, and the comparatively small stake of less than $1 billion is another clue.

What's really intriguing about the position in Red Hat is that the company agreed to be acquired by International Business Machines (IBM) for $34 billion in October 2018. Despite this, Buffett entered his position in Q4 2018, then bought more in each of 2019's first two quarters. The deal - intended to boost Big Blue's cloud-based services business - closed in early July, so Red Hat's shares no longer trade on the public markets. Thus, Red Hat won't show up in Berkshire's portfolio as of the third-quarter filing.

Ironically, IBM is one of Warren Buffett's most high-profile bad bets. The usually tech-shy investor surprised Wall Street when Berkshire Hathaway revealed in 2011 that it scooped up nearly $11 billion worth of Big Blue. Buffett added to the stake in the ensuing years before souring on IBM in 2017. Berkshire eventually sold its entire position.

25. Amazon.com

Shares held: 537,300

Holding value: $1,017,447,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.49%

Amazon.com (AMZN, $1,776.12) is Berkshire Hathaway's splashiest new stock pick. The holding company disclosed it initiated a position of 483,300 shares in the first quarter of 2019, then added another 54,000 shares in Q2.

It wasn't Buffett's idea, though.

The clue? Before Berkshire Hathaway submitted its first-quarter regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett told CNBC: ""One of the fellows in the office that manage money ... bought some Amazon, so it will show up (when that file is submitted).""

Buffett has long been an admirer of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, he admitted in an interview, and said he wished he'd bought the stock sooner.

""Yeah, I've been a fan, and I've been an idiot for not buying"" AMZN shares, Buffett told CNBC. Berkshire still is an insignificant shareholder, however, boasting about 0.1% of Amazon's shares outstanding.

24. Costco

Getty Images





Shares held: 4,333,363

Holding value: $1,145,135,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.55%

Costco (COST, $271.52) joined the ranks of the Buffett stocks a long time back - the first quarter of 2001, to be precise. So while Costco is not a particularly large holding, at just more than half a percent of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, it's a seemingly cherished one.

And it's a company Buffett is happy to chat about at length.

""Here (Kraft Heinz) are, 100 years plus, tons of advertising, built into people's habits and everything else,"" Buffett told CNBC in a February 2019 interview. ""And now, Kirkland, a private label brand, comes along and with only 250 or so outlets, does 50% more business than all the Kraft Heinz brands.""

Indeed, Costco's Kirkland store-branded products are one of the warehouse retailer's biggest draws. Revenues from the Kirkland label totaled $39 billion last year - more than 27% of Costco's overall annual sales, and about 50% greater than Kraft Heinz's total sales across 2018.

Berkshire's 4.3 million shares represent a roughly 1% equity stake in the company - not unsubstantial, but well outside Costco's top 10 institutional stakes.

23. PNC Financial Services

Getty Images





Shares held: 8,671,054

Holding value: $1,190,362,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.57%

PNC Financial Services (PNC, $124.74), the nation's sixth-largest bank by assets and second-largest regional lender, is part of a big recent bet by Buffett on the financial sector.

Buffett first started investing in PNC in the third quarter of 2018. He upped Berkshire Hathaway's stake by another 4% in Q1 2019. The holding company is now PNC's 10th-largest investor with 1.9% of the bank's shares outstanding.

Buffett has long been comfortable with investing in the banking business. At the 1995 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, he said the industry ""falls within our circle of competence to evaluate."" Given Berkshire's big push into banks over the past few quarters - BRK.B has added to or started new positions in more than a half-dozen financial stocks recently - Buffett clearly sees a lot of value in this corner of the market.

22. Mastercard

Getty Images





Shares held: 4,934,756

Holding value: $1,305,391,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.63%

Warren Buffett credits Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Mastercard (MA, $271.89) to his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and he wishes he had pulled the trigger on the opportunity earlier.

""I could have bought them as well, and looking back, I should have,"" Buffett said about Visa (V) and Mastercard in 2018, referring to his own investment in American Express.

As noted above with StoneCo, Buffett is a big believer in companies that process payments.

Berkshire Hathaway initiated its position in Mastercard during the first quarter of 2011, and given the stock's performance ever since, it's obvious why Buffett wishes Berkshire Hathaway owned more. Including dividends, MA shares have generated an annualized return of 34.8% since March 31, 2011.

21. American Airlines

Getty Images





Shares held: 43,700,000

Holding value: $1,425,057,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.68%

Warren Buffett isn't afraid to change his mind, and perhaps his most surprising volte-face came in regard to the airline industry. Buffett long excoriated the sector, calling it a ""death trap"" for investors.

""If a capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk back in the early 1900s he should've shot Orville Wright; he would have saved his progeny money,"" Buffett once wrote.

But airline stocks became Buffett stocks in 2016. That's when he started picking up stakes in four major carriers, including American Airlines (AAL, $25.41). Years of industry consolidation and Buffett's confidence in the U.S. economy's long-term dynamism finally made the time ripe for Berkshire Hathaway to buy.

""It's true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They're like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope,"" he told CNBC.

Berkshire Hathaway initiated a stake in AAL in the third quarter of 2016. Buffett has been an incremental seller ever since to remain below a 10% ownership threshold that would trigger regulatory headaches. Berkshire Hathaway is American's second-largest shareholder with 9.7% of the firm's shares outstanding.

Shares held (Class A / Class C): 14,860,360 / 31,090,985

Holding value (Class A / Class C): $561,871,000 / $1,180,836,000

Percent of portfolio (Total): 0.84%

Sirius XM is the company so nice, Buffett needs to own it twice. Well, thrice. Sort of.

When dealing with John Malone's companies, it gets complicated.

Liberty Media has for years held a large stake in Sirius XM Holdings. But in 2015, the company actually recapitalized, offering (among other things) several tracking stocks that allowed investors to enjoy in the performance of Liberty's Sirius XM investment directly rather than get it piecemeal through Liberty Media itself.

Thus, Buffett was exposed to Sirius XM before it directly invested in SIRI shares in Q4 2016. But over time, he has bought more of the tracking stock, which currently represents a 70.4% stake in Sirius XM. The Berkshire Hathaway portfolio now holds roughly 46 million shares of Liberty Sirius XM Group Series A (LSXMA, $39.50) and Liberty Sirius XM Group Series C (LSXMK, $40.05) combined.

In fact, Warren Buffett is the largest institutional shareholder in each class, holding 4.6% of Liberty Sirius XM's A shares, and 14.7% of the C shares. Combined with his SIRI stake, the Oracle of Omaha holds three different investments in Sirius XM.

19. Visa

Shares held: 10,562,460

Holding value: $1,833,115,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.88%

Like Mastercard, Visa (V, $176.27) was the idea of lieutenants Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler (Buffett won't tell). And as with Mastercard, Buffett wishes BRK.B had bought more. Visa operates the world's largest payments network, and thus is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of cashless transactions and digital mobile payments.

Berkshire Hathaway first bought Visa in the third quarter of 2011, and it has proven to be a winner of a stock pick. Including dividends, Visa has delivered a whopping annualized return of almost 33% since Sept. 30, 2011.

""If I had been as smart as Ted or Todd, I would have (bought Visa),"" Buffett told shareholders at the 2018 annual meeting.

Berkshire owns 0.5% of Visa's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

18. United Continental

Shares held: 21,938,642

Holding value: $1,920,728,000

Percent of portfolio: 0.92%

United Continental (UAL, $81.62) is one of the four major airline stocks that Buffett bought during the third quarter of 2016 when he surprised the market with his about-face on the industry.

Less than a year later, it represented something of a black eye when a passenger was injured while being removed against his will from a sold-out flight. But United has recovered from that reputational hit, in part simply because there are so few options that boast its geographical reach.

As noted above with American Airlines, Buffett thinks air carriers today offer much better growth prospects than they did in the last century, which was a bloodbath for capital.

Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio holds 8.2% of UAL shares outstanding, making it the airline's second-largest shareholder. United's stock has delivered an annualized total return of about 19% since the end of Q3 2016.

17. Charter Communications

Getty Images





Shares held: 5,426,609

Holding value: $2,144,487,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.03%

Charter Communications (CHTR, $380.94) is yet another Berkshire Hathaway portfolio holding with a John Malone connection - albeit a small one now. Malone served on the telecom and media company's board of directors from 2013 until 2018, when he stepped down to concentrate his focus on a smaller group of companies. (He does remain a director emeritus, however.)

Charter Communications markets cable TV, internet, telephone and other services under the Spectrum brand, which is America's second-largest cable operator behind Comcast (CMCSA). It greatly expanded its reach in 2016 when it acquired Time Warner Cable and sister company Bright House Networks.

Buffett entered CHTR in the second quarter of 2014, but he has seemingly lost his love for the telecom company in recent years. His position has been trimmed down from 9.4 million shares in early 2017 to just 5.4 million shares as of Berkshire's most recent 13F. The move away from Charter meshed with a lousy 2018 for the stock, which lost 15% that year, though Buffett dropped another fifth of his position in Q1 2019 - during which CHTR roared ahead by nearly 22%. Berkshire shed another 284,102 in the second quarter.

The current stake represents about 1% of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, and a decent-sized 2.4% ownership in Charter.

Shares held: 38,565,570

Holding value: $2,169,698,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.04%

Berkshire disclosed a position in DaVita (DVA, $58.36) in the first quarter of 2012.

Since DVA was a large position of Ted Weschler's Peninsula Capital in his pre-Berkshire days, it wasn't unreasonable to assume that it was his pick. Weschler confirmed as much in 2014.

DaVita, which provides kidney care and operates dialysis centers, serves more than 1.7 million patients in the U.S. and nine other countries. Aging baby boomers and a graying population in many developed markets should provide a strong, secular tailwind.

Berkshire, by the way, is DaVita's largest shareholder by a wide margin. Its stake of 38.6 million shares accounts for 23% of DVA's shares outstanding.

15. Verisign

Shares held: 12,952,745

Holding value: $2,709,196,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.30%

Stocks aren't good or bad in a bubble - one investor's brilliant purchase often is, depending on timing, another investor's biggest failure.

Take Verisign (VRSN, $203.40) - an internet infrastructure service company that quite literally keeps the world connected online and acts as a domain registry for the .com, .net and other top-level domains.

Stanley Druckenmiller, a famed former hedge fund manager, made a $200 million short on tech stocks in early 1999 while investing for George Soros' Quantum Fund, but lost $600 million in the trade. He then tried to win it back via a big $6 billion buy-in of tech stocks including Verisign ... but he lost $3 billion in six weeks as VRSN and several other recent purchases flopped, making it one of the ""smart money's"" worst stock calls of all time.

The Oracle of Omaha has had an entirely different experience.

Berkshire bought Verisign, whose dominance of the space exemplifies Buffett's love of deep moats, during a dip in the final quarter of 2012. The roughly 3.7 million shares were purchased at an average cost of $38.82 per share. VRSN has returned more than 420% since the end of 2012 - well more than triple the S&P 500's roughly 127% return including dividends.

Berkshire Hathaway now owns almost 13 million shares in the company, making it the largest institutional investor in Verisign at a 10.8% ownership stake.

Shares held: 53,649,213

Holding value: $2,724,307,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.31%

Southwest Airlines (LUV, $48.21) is part of the quartet of major airline stocks Buffett bought in late 2016. The discount carrier is beloved by its customers and employees alike, typically finding itself near the top of ""Best Airline"" and ""Best Places to Work For"" lists.

As an investment, it has performed decently within the Berkshire fold. LUV has generated an annualized total return of 14.3% since Aug. 31, 2016.

Berkshire Hathaway pared its position in LUV by 2%, or 1.2 million shares in the first quarter of 2019, but that doesn't mean Buffett is suddenly bearish. The selling was necessary to keep Berkshire's ownership stake below 10%, which would trigger regulatory hassles.

BRK.B remains Southwest Airlines second-largest shareholder, holding 9.9% of the company's shares outstanding, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

13. General Motors

Getty Images





Shares held: 72,269,696

Holding value: $2,784,551,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.34%

Warren Buffett first took a stake in General Motors (GM, $36.47), the world's fourth-largest auto manufacturer by production, in early 2012. He most recently upped Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he increased his position by 37%.

With more than 72 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway is General Motors' fourth-largest investor, holding more than 5% of the car company's shares outstanding.

In many ways, GM looks like a classic Buffett value bet.

General Motors is an iconic American brand and, as the No. 1 domestic automaker, a bet on the long-term growth of the U.S. economy. Buffett has sung the praises of GM CEO Mary Barra several times, at one point saying, ""Mary is as strong as they come. She is as good as I've seen.""

GM also looks like a value pick. The stock trades at just 5.7 times expected earnings, according to data from Refinitiv, and sports a dividend yield of 4.2%. Buffett paid an estimated average price per share of $31.82 when he initiated his position in the first quarter of 2012. Including dividends, General Motors has returned 78% since March 30, 2012.

Shares held: 80,937,250

Holding value: $3,573,379,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.72%

Despite its impressive-sounding moniker, Bank of New York Mellon (BK, $41.67) is not exactly a household name. But it's a big deal in financial services, and Warren Buffett has been a fan for some time.

Bank of New York Mellon is a custodian bank that holds assets for institutional clients and provides back-end accounting services. Its roots actually go all the way back to 1784, when Bank of New York was founded by a group including Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. Today, BK is the nation's ninth-largest bank by assets, according to data from the Federal Reserve.

Berkshire Hathaway first took a position in BK back in the third quarter of 2010, when it paid an estimated average price of $43.90. Warren Buffett last added to Berkshire's stake in BK in the fourth quarter of 2018, when he increased his holding company's investment by 3%, or more than 3 million shares. With a total of 80.9 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway owns 8.5% of all shares outstanding, making it BK's largest investor by a decent margin. (Vanguard is No. 2 at 6.8%.)

11. Goldman Sachs

Shares held: 18,353,635

Holding value: $3,755,154,000

Percent of portfolio: 1.80%

Just because Buffett soured on Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Verizon, don't think he's lost his love of Dow stocks.

Berkshire Hathaway first picked up its stake in Goldman Sachs (GS, $196.18) during the 2008 financial crisis. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants to purchase common stock. The preferred shares came with a dividend yield of 10% - almost twice the rate of some preferred stocks, which already are considered generous income plays.

Goldman redeemed its preferred shares in 2011. Berkshire bought another $2 billion in GS stock when it exercised the warrants in 2013.

Buffett has parlayed the original investment into a 5% stake in Wall Street's preeminent investment bank, worth more than $3.7 billion. Berkshire is now the bank's fourth-largest shareholder.

For an industry he once shunned, Buffett sure does like his airline stocks now.

And from the looks of things, Delta Air Lines (DAL, $57.11), which was part of the group of air carriers he first picked up in the third quarter of 2016, might be his favorite.

Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in DAL by 8%, or 5.4 million shares, during the first quarter of 2019. Indeed, the holding company is now Delta's largest shareholder, owning 10.4% of the carrier's shares outstanding. Buffett explained to CNBC that Berkshire crossed the 10% threshold because Delta bought back so much of its own stock.

Once he found out he had ""lost his virginity,"" Buffett said, he decided to buy more DAL shares anyway.

Moody's (MCO, $209.95) is a business and financial services firm that's best known for its Moody's Investors Service credit rating arm - one of the three major American business credit ratings agencies alongside Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. It also offers financial analysis technology via Moody's Analytics.

MCO is a longtime, significant holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio - and an ironic one to boot.

""Uncle Warren"" first dipped his toe in during the first quarter of 2001, and he has been content with his investment of late, leaving his 24.7 million-share stake unchanged over the past couple of years.

The funny thing about Berkshire's holding in Moody's is that Buffett said back in 2010 that ""Our job is to rate credit ourselves. We do not outsource that to ratings agencies."" Yet Berkshire Hathaway is the largest institutional holder of MCO, owning 13.1% of the financial firm. (Vanguard is a distant second at 7.9%.)

The holding is meaningful on Buffett's end, too. At more than 2%, Moody's is one of Berkshire's 10 largest positions.

Holding value: $6,653,769,000

Percent of portfolio: 3.20%

Warren Buffett has been going all in on big banks over the past year. Berkshire Hathaway initiated a position in JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $105.20), the nation's largest bank by assets, in the third quarter of 2018 and has been boosting it ever since. BRK.B's upped its stake by 40% in the fourth quarter of last year and again by 18% in the first quarter of 2019.

As noted, Buffett added to or started new positions in several American mega-banks and investment firms over the past couple of quarters.

Part of the attraction for JPMorgan is due to Warren Buffett's professed admiration for CEO Jamie Dimon. The two have partnered with Jeff Bezos, chairman and CEO of Amazon.com, to form a health care initiative intended to improve coverage and lower costs. Dimon and Buffett also have teamed up to decry the practice of giving quarterly profit forecasts, saying ""short-termism is hurting the economy.""

Holding value: $6,940,884,000

Percent of portfolio: 3.34%

U.S. Bancorp (USB, $51.28) is one of the oldest Buffett stocks in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The Oracle initiated his position in the first quarter of 2006.

Buffett is notoriously tight-lipped about U.S. Bancorp, Barron's notes, but the nation's fifth-largest bank by assets and America's biggest regional bank has been a solid stock pick. The lender has consistently generated the highest returns among the top 10 banks.

Warren Buffett just boosted Berkshire Hathaway's stake in USB during the second quarter, with a small addition of about 132 million shares. The position now accounts for 3.3% of the holding company's equity portfolio. BRK.B is the company's largest shareholder, owning 8.3% of its shares outstanding. Vanguard, a large shareholder in many blue chips, is No. 2 with a 7.2% stake.

Shares in the bank have delivered an annualized total return of 7% since March 31, 2006.

Warren Buffett was one of the driving forces behind the 2015 merger of packaged-food giant Kraft and ketchup purveyor Heinz to create Kraft Heinz (KHC, $25.06). It's Berkshire's sixth-largest stock investment with a current market value of $10.1 billion.

And Buffett regrets it.

Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $3 billion non-cash loss from an impairment of intangible assets in 2018, ""arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz,"" Buffett wrote in his 2019 letter to shareholders.

More succinctly, in an interview with CNBC, Buffett said ""I was wrong"" on KHC. Yup, he says he overpaid. Kraft's shares have lost 18.5% on an annualized total return basis since Sept. 30, 2015.

Berkshire Hathaway owns 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, making it the food company's second-largest shareholder, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Private investment firm 3G Capital - who teamed up with Berkshire in 2013 to purchase H.J. Heinz - is tops at 48.8%.

5. American Express

Shares held: 151,610,700

Percent of portfolio: 8.99%

Buffett likes to say this his preferred holding period is ""forever."" Look no further than Dow component American Express (AXP, $122.38) to understand just how serious he is about investing for the long haul.

Buffett picked up his initial stake in the credit card company in 1963, when a struggling AmEx badly needed capital. Berkshire obliged, getting favorable terms on its investment. Buffett has played the role of white knight many times over the years, including during the 2008 financial crisis, as a means to get stakes in good companies at a discount. (Think: Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.)

Berkshire Hathaway, which owns 18% of American Express' shares outstanding, is by far the company's largest shareholder. No. 2 Vanguard owns less than 6%. Buffett praised the power of AmEx's brand at Berkshire's 2019 annual meeting. ""It's a fantastic story, and I'm glad we own 18% of it,"" he said.

4. Wells Fargo

Shares held: 409,803,773

Percent of portfolio: 9.79%

Wells Fargo (WFC, $43.38) has been roiled by a series of scandals since 2016, including opening millions of phony accounts, modifying mortgages without authorization and charging customers for auto insurance they did not need.

It's been a slow clean-up process. The bank in early June reached a $386 million deal to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by customers who say WFC forced them to buy unnecessary car insurance.

But Buffett appears to stand by the nation's fourth-largest bank by assets. ""If you look at Wells, through this whole thing they're uncovering a whole lot of problems, but they aren't losing any customers to speak of,"" Buffett told Financial Times in an April interview. Berkshire Hathaway first bought shares in WFC in 2001. Although Buffett pared the stake by 3%, or 17 million shares, in the first quarter of 2019, Wells Fargo still is an outsize holding in Berkshire's portfolio.

And Berkshire remains WFC's largest shareholder with 8.4% of all shares outstanding.

Shares held: 400,000,000

Percent of portfolio: 9.79%

Buffett, an unabashed fan of Cherry Coke, started investing in Coca-Cola (KO, $53.87) soon after the stock market crash of 1987. In his 1988 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he expected to hold on to the stock ""for a long time.""

Three decades later, he has proven true to his word. Berkshire is KO's largest shareholder with 9.4% of its shares outstanding.

Coca-Cola made a brief appearance as a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 1930s. Shares were added back to the Dow in 1987, and they've remained a stalwart member ever since.

While Coca-Cola's stock performance hasn't impressed - its 55% total returns over the past five years come up about six percentage points shy of the S&P 500 - it has been an income investor's dream. The beverage maker has increased its dividend annually for 57 years.

2. Bank of America

Shares held: 927,248,600

Holding value: $26,890,210,000

Percent of portfolio: 12.92%

It should be clear by now that Buffett is bonkers for bank stocks. And the crown jewel of his financial sector holdings is Bank of America (BAC, $26.25), the nation's second-largest bank by assets.

Buffett's interest in BAC dates back to 2011, when he swooped in to shore up the firm's finances in the wake of the Great Recession. In exchange for investing $5 billion in the firm, Berkshire received preferred stock yielding 6% and warrants giving Berkshire the right to purchase BofA common stock at a steep discount. (The Oracle of Omaha exercised those warrants in 2017, netting a $12 billion profit in the process.)

Warren Buffett recently tacked on to his position, adding roughly 927 million shares during the second quarter of 2019. That's an upgrade of about 3% for Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire now holds 927.2 million shares, worth $26.9 billion.

BofA is a big deal for Berkshire Hathaway, and it works the other way around, too. BAC shares account for a whopping 12.9% of Buffett's equity portfolio. By the same token, Berkshire is Bank of America's largest shareholder, at 9.1% of its shares outstanding.

Apple (AAPL, $201.74) is king of the Buffett stocks. The Oracle of Omaha has never been much of a tech investor, but he sure does love Apple. He took his first bite in early 2016, and the iPhone maker has since become Berkshire Hathaway's single-largest holding. Brace yourselves: AAPL accounts for nearly a quarter of the total value of Berkshire Hathaway's equity portfolio.

And at almost 250 million shares, BRK.B is Apple's third-largest investor. The holding company owns 5.1% of all AAPL shares outstanding. Only Vanguard and BlackRock - giants of the passively managed index fund universe - hold more Apple stock.

Unlike many of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings, Buffett has been happy to discuss his ardor for Apple. As he has said more than once on CNBC, he loves the power of Apple's brand and its ecosystem of products (such as the iPhone and iPad) and services (such as Apple Pay and iTunes).

""I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year,"" Buffett has said. ""I focus on the ... hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who practically live their lives by (the iPhone).""

(BRK.B) is a conglomerate holding company that is best known for its iconic chief executive officer, Warren Buffett. Otherwise known as ""The Oracle of Omaha,"" Buffett has been building the company for more than five decades and is one of the wealthiest people in the world—estimated to have a $68.1 billion net worth as of 2020, per Forbes.

Berkshire Hathaway started as a textile manufacturing firm in which Buffett began acquiring shares early in his career. By 1965, he had taken control of the company outright.

Buffett soon began exiting the textile mill business and adding businesses from other industries including insurance, retail, and media to Berkshire's overall portfolio. Berkshire has continued acquiring stakes in financial services, utilities, and manufacturing. Berkshire has a market capitalization of $419 billion as of May 2020.

Along the way, Buffett has built a reputation as one of history's greatest investors, which makes Berkshire Hathaway stock coveted by other investors.

The Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio

Berkshire Hathaway is not a traditional company. It is a conglomerate of many different companies and exists only as a collection of stakes in publicly traded companies. Changes made by Buffett in the Berkshire portfolio often move the stock prices of the companies traded and get significant media coverage.

The portfolio's top five holdings as of March 31, 2020, included Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP), and Wells Fargo (WFC).

The big stake in Apple was of particular interest to Buffett-watchers, as he's historically been averse to investing in technology stocks.

Warren Buffett's Management Style

Buffett is a long-term, buy-and-hold investor focused on value. He has long been known to focus his investments on companies that he knows. As such, he tends to avoid higher risk momentum names. His preference is for well-established, slower-growth businesses. Buffett typically makes investments with plans to hold them for at least 10 years.

One of Buffett's more popular quotes is, “It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.”

One of Berkshire's more recent buyouts, the purchase of Precision Castparts for $235 per share in cash in 2015, diverged slightly from Buffett's traditional investment style. The company is typical of the type of businesses Buffett tends to favor. However, Berkshire paid a 21% premium per share to buy it, departing from Buffett's preference for good value in his trades.

Berkshire Hathaway's Performance

Buffett's investment style and choices make for a conservative portfolio overall, with less than average volatility. The principle of risk and return suggests stocks with lower risk levels also provide lower return potential.

While Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500's performance over the five-year period ending May 20, 2020, Berkshire has significantly outperformed the benchmark index over the 10- and 20-year time horizons. This performance demonstrates Buffett has been able to deliver above-average returns at below-average risk over the long term.

Income investors likely find the lack of a dividend yield as one of the only drawbacks of investing in Berkshire Hathaway stock. Berkshire has only paid a dividend once in 1967 and has not paid one since.

For those considering Berkshire Hathaway as an individual retirement account (IRA) holding, this is less of a concern, as withdrawals from IRA accounts are generally not permitted until the individual reaches age 59½.

The Two Share Price Classes

One of the most unusual features of Berkshire Hathaway stock is its stock price. It never splits. On May 19, 2020, Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares (BRK.A) closed at $258,700 per share. This puts even a single share purchase out of reach of many investors. Buffett has made it clear that he prefers to attract long-term investors as opposed to traders.

In 1996, Buffett partially conceded, issuing a Class B block of shares to make his company more accessible. These shares made a 50-for-1 stock split in January 2010 and trade at $172.49 per share as of May 19, 2020.

There is essentially no difference in these shares outside of the stock price. Trading flexibility is the primary advantage of Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares.

Does Berkshire Hathaway Fit in an IRA Account?

The portfolio's composition of well-established mature businesses that can operate successfully in most market environments makes Berkshire Hathaway an investment that is appropriate for most IRA accounts. Buffett's style of investing for the long-term aligns well with the long-term nature of IRA accounts.

Younger investors can use the stock as a core long-term holding for growing portfolios. Retirees will likely maintain a lower equity allocation in their portfolios overall with capital preservation being a primary consideration. However, equities are still needed in these portfolios to help stay ahead of inflation, and Berkshire Hathaway can be an ideal choice to fill out that part of the portfolio.

The Bottom Line

For most investors, the Class B shares are the only option when looking to add Berkshire Hathaway to an IRA. The maximum annual contribution to an IRA is $6,000 a year for 2019 and 2020, although people who are 50 and older can contribute an additional $1,000.

This means the Class A shares and their price of over $325,000 are not an option unless the investor has built up a sizable portfolio. The Class B shares are within the reach of all investors."
171,Highly rated U.S. companies are borrowing $1 trillion at a record clip,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/highly-rated-us-companies-are-borrowing-1-trillion-at-a-record-clip-2020-05-21,2020-05-21 00:00:00,"The coronavirus pandemic has spurred U.S. companies with investment-grade credit ratings to borrow at the fastest pace in history to start a year, with new bond issuance topping $1 trillion in less than five months, supported by Federal Reserve programs to buy corporate bonds.

That is the quickest clip ever for new investment-grade corporate bond supply to kick off a year, according to BofA Global analysts, who pointed out that the $1 trillion threshold was eclipsed on Tuesday.

The borrowing spree is notable not only because it’s about double the pace seen last year over the same period, per BofA data, but also for how easily its been for companies to borrow cheaply, while paying investors so little to bankroll their operations in an uncertain environment.

“Concessions are near to nothing at this point,” said Wendy Wyatt, portfolio manager, DuPont Capital Management, referring to the slight discount in price investors typically get when buying newly minted bonds, versus similar, existing bonds in the market.

She said the old “bait and switch,” common during bull markets, is alive and well. “They offer a nice, attractive spread to get people interested and then walk it in aggressively,” she told MarketWatch. While bankers are hired to cut the best possible deal for their corporate clients, the process also ends up handing investors bonds that pay substantially less than expected.

As an example, AutoNation Inc. AN, -0.32% a national chain of car dealerships, with credit ratings one step above speculative-grade (or junk-bond) territory at Baa3/BBB-, borrowed $500 million in the bond market Tuesday, just as issuance hit $1 trillion. The company ended up paying a yield of 4.8%, after pricing narrowed by as much as 77 basis points from initial guidance circulated by bankers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the dealings.

AutoNation was one of several public companies that gave back funding from the U.S. Treasury Department’s hallmark $670 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which aims to help small businesses stay float during the pandemic by covering payroll. The Treasury warned earlier in May that the program was not meant for “a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets.”

Like many of its peers, AutoNation swung to a net loss of $232.3 million in the first-quarter, or $2.58 a share, from net income of $92.0 million, or $1.01 a share, in the year-ago period, as car sales plunged during nationwide shutdowns. Although it reported a slight pickup in late April as more states reopened.

A spokesperson said AutoNation was pleased by investor interest in its new bond deal, which saw strong demand.

This CreditSights chart shows how revenue growth already was slumping at highly rated U.S. companies even before the coronavirus left many industries with flat, or negative growth, in the first quarter.

Median revenue growth barely positive CreditSights

Being a part of the trillion-dollar club, whether by market capitalization like tech-giants Microsoft Corp., MSFT, +0.04% or Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.64% , or in terms of world economies, used to a big thing.

But it’s become less stunning as the U.S. corporate bond world has mushroomed over the past decade, reaching $9.6 trillion on issue and rivaling the $10.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities market at the end of last year.

And it’s gotten even harder lately to square what $1 trillion really means, particularly as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet nears $7 trillion and Congress is urging it to unleash the more than $2 trillion in emergency funds approved to help bridge businesses, states, cities and households through coronavirus shutdowns.

This year’s dizzying pace of corporate borrowing comes as U.S. stocks have shrugged off the worst of the coronavirus selloff in March, with investors feeling bullish about the path of the U.S. economic recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.03% headed lower Thursday, but in the prior session ended only about 17% below its February all-time closing record, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

What could go wrong? While a lot of attention has been paid to new borrowing activity, there also has been a blistering pace of credit-ratings firm downgrades hitting U.S. investment-grade companies, with BofA tracking more than $1 trillion since the end of February.

This chart shows the speed of downgrades, in days, so far in this cycle when compared with prior crises.

Flood of downgrades BofA Global

Wyatt warned that credit ratings painted too rosy a picture of U.S. corporations, particularly since many companies were “over leveraged going into the crisis,” and now face a revenue hit from weeks of lockdowns designed to tamp down the coronavirus.

“I’d say the credit-rating firms were too slow to act in the past two years, based on pure fundamental metrics,” Wyatt said.

“Now they have to borrow a year’s worth of cash to burn, to keep the company moving forward, but their ability to continue to pay that indebtedness has decreased.”

We check hedge fund and billionaire investor sentiment before delving into hours of research. Hedge funds spend millions of dollars on Ivy League graduates, unconventional data sources, expert networks, and get tips from investment bankers and industry insiders. Sure they sometimes fail miserably, but their consensus stock picks historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk factors.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) investors should be aware of an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers of late. MSFT was in 235 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. There were 189 hedge funds in our database with MSFT holdings at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that MSFT ranked #2 among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 44 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter. Even if you aren't comfortable with shorting stocks, you should at least avoid initiating long positions in stocks that are in our short portfolio.

174,It’s a Weird Market. Time To Go Active.,https://www.barrons.com/articles/active-stock-picking-strategies-gain-appeal-as-markets-fluctuate-51590192074,None,"Text size

If stockpickers have a chance of salvaging their reputations, this is it. A violent selloff and equally rapid ascent in the stock market has caused mispricings and created massive disparities among sectors and stocks, giving actively managed mutual funds an opportunity to beat the index’s return, after lagging behind badly throughout the long bull market.

Some financial advisors, including longtime skeptics of active management, are moving money into these strategies. They believe that the market is acting irrationally enough to give good managers the chance of beating their benchmarks, and that a longtime trend toward lower fees has lowered the hurdle to outperformance.

“It makes sense to be surgical now more than ever,” says Ron Carson, CEO and founder of Carson Group, an Omaha advisory, which last quarter added an active strategy to U.S. stock allocations and is in the process of switching all of its developed international allocation to active funds from about a 50-50 split.

“When the economy is humming along, the rising tide raises all boats. But we’re going to see a major contraction this quarter and massive volatility,” Carson says. “To find companies gaining market share even if their prices are going down takes a manager digging into a company’s debt structure, free cash flow, fundamentals. Talking to suppliers, looking upstream and downstream. Hours of homework.”

The move by Carson and other advisors is a fresh vote of confidence for actively managed mutual funds, most of which trailed passive strategies throughout the long bull market. In August, the amount invested in passive funds hit $4.3 trillion, exceeding assets under active management among individual investors for the first time and cementing the dominance of indexing. For some advisors, however, pruning passive and adding active exposure began before the February stock market pullback, as they prepared for what they thought would be an end to the 11-year bull market and lower returns in 2020.

“The markets were overbought, and there’s no cerebral cortex to a passive approach,” says Andrew Rosen, an advisor at Diversified in Wilmington, Del. “We use passive to grab big swaths of the market, but added active managers to tilt portfolios and use rationale to increase and decrease positions.”

Rosen says that he continued to add active managers as the market pulled back sharply in response to Covid-19. “We wanted to both protect on the downside and position for a recovery,” says Rosen, who switched 10% of his passive holdings to active, including all international stock investments and some U.S. stock and fixed-income holdings. He particularly likes T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (ticker: TRBCX), Federated MDT Small Cap Growth (QASGX), Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets (ODMAX), and Baird Aggregate Bond (BAGIX).

For years, active managers have been making the case that they would shine in a market downturn, using human intelligence and financial analysis to assess stocks that were unfairly punished. The logic is sound, but the execution is tough.

Among active U.S. stock funds, winning managers are almost always in the minority. Consider that there was no rolling five-year period over the 22 years from 1997 to 2018 in which more than 50% of managers beat their Morningstar category, according to Morningstar research. For the rolling periods ending in each of the five years from 2014 to 2018, less than 20% of managers had success.

The data cast a better light on U.S. stock fund managers during periods of unrest in the markets. The high-water mark for actively managed U.S. stock funds was after the technology bubble burst in 2000, when more than 70% of active fund strategies beat passive counterparts.

“It was a turkey shoot in the sense you had this extreme divergence between growth stocks and value, large and small, domestic and foreign,” says Jeffrey Ptak, global director of manager research for Morningstar. “When you have those kinds of spreads, it’s a boon for active investors. Success rates went through the roof.”

In the recent V-shape downdraft and bounce in stock prices through April, 48% of U.S. active stock managers outperformed their category indexes. During the downswing from Feb. 19 to the trough on March 23, 53% outperformed, according to Morningstar.

Looking ahead, advisors say they expect the climate to continue to be tough for stockpickers in the large-cap space.

“We had a major market break, but the leadership in large-cap stocks hasn’t changed—the Big Five ( Amazon.com [AMZN], Alphabet’s Google [GOOGL], Apple [AAPL], Facebook [FB], and Microsoft [MSFT]) account for over 20% of the S&P 500 index,” says John Apruzzese, chief investment officer at Evercore Wealth Management, who is in the process of shifting all international exposure to active strategies. “People would think it would be active managers’ heyday, but it’s very difficult to outperform the S&P 500 when the megastocks are still leading.”

Those who are adding active management in U.S. large-cap allocations are nibbling rather than making big changes, often choosing concentrated portfolios of 30 to 40 stocks so the manager has agility and flexibility—theoretically, at least—to dodge risks and snap up opportunities.

Judith McGee, chairwoman and CEO of McGee Wealth Management in Portland, Ore., has long favored active managers but has held about 15% in passive options, primarily in U.S. stocks. She recently reduced that to 5%, adding a high-conviction U.S. value manager, American Funds American Mutual (AMRFX) and an active ETF with a focus on technology called ARK Innovation (ARKK).

“We’re not just looking at offense; this is for defense, too,” McGee says. Both active funds have a strong record: Each trounced benchmarks and at least 90% of peers in the past one, three, and five years.

The shift to active strategies has been more aggressive in small-cap U.S. stocks, international stocks, and fixed income, where actively managed funds have a higher success rate and many of the indexes are structurally unappealing to advisors. “We are moving from a mix of active and passive in international developed stocks to all active,” says Evercore’s Apruzzese. “The international indexes [are] full of things we don’t want.”

“ A lot of companies today are financially fragile, and some are not. There’s opportunity for people who can understand which are which. ” — Lori Van Dusen

For example, banks have been weakened by negative interest rates and dividend cuts, Apruzzese says. Auto manufacturers are grappling with weak sales and the high cost of switching to electric vehicles, and oil companies are facing major restructuring needs and dividend cuts, he adds.

Last year, 46% of U.S. small-blend managers beat their indexes compared with 35% of U.S. large-blend funds. The benchmark-beating rate among international stockpickers was significantly higher: 58% of foreign large-blend and 68% of diversified emerging markets managers.

Obviously, switching to active management is successful only if the advisor picks the right mangers. Academic studies have shown that it’s difficult to predict which managers will outperform, but one good indicator is fees. Lower-fee funds produce the highest returns across every asset class. Other factors that advisors prioritize are low turnover (to keep taxes down), easy access to managers, and a high active share. Low active share means that a fund looks just like the benchmark—owning the same stocks in roughly the same proportion, making it hard to justify higher fees.

Lori Van Dusen, founder and CEO of LVW Advisors in Pittsford, N.Y., acknowledges that even if you invest with the best manager, moving away from index investing comes with a risk. “If you get a big broad-market bounce, you might miss it,” she says, but adds that the dislocations in some major global markets have been extreme and are best analyzed by seasoned stockpickers. She has shifted assets to active managers in U.S. small-caps, emerging markets, and fixed income.

That’s completely different than her approach through the 2008 market rout. Coming out of 2008, stocks were cheap and bond interest-rate spreads blew out so dramatically that investors couldn’t go wrong in index funds, Van Dusen says. “Now, with a rolling gradual opening of the economy, you have to have a lot more skill in small-caps and debt to understand the difference between solvency and liquidity issues,” she says. “A lot of companies today are financially fragile, and some are not. There’s opportunity for people who can understand which are which.”

A Chance to Shine Market turmoil favors active management $24 Billion

The amount that went into active funds in January and February, reversing a 10-month trend of steady outflows

Active fixed-income funds haven’t had a great track record lately in beating their benchmarks. Among corporate bond funds, just 26% did last year and 48% in 2018. But with interest rates so low, index funds in fixed income don’t seem poised for a big bump this year, so many advisors are selecting unconstrained fixed-income managers, who can pick and choose where to invest across fixed-income asset classes and internationally.

“With the 30-year Treasury paying around 1.5%, it’s almost impossible to make money passively in bonds right now,” says Steve Podnos, a principal at Wealth Care in Cocoa Beach, Fla., who recently raised his active allocation in fixed income from 70% to 90%. “And what happens when interest rates start to go up? Passive medium- to long-term investments will get hammered. Being active allows us to invest both domestically and internationally in a number of different areas of fixed income.” He favors Pimco Income (PONAX), DFA Five Year Global Fixed Income Portfolio (DFGBX), and Fidelity Total Bond (FTBFX).

Some advisors who traditionally avoided active managers because of high fees say that a steady, yearslong decline in fees has been a game changer. “We’ve always been extremely fee conscious; fees have compressed enough that active fees are justified,” says Leon LaBrecque, chief growth officer at Sequoia Financial Group in Troy, Mich. He has fully embraced active management in fixed income and is considering adding active managers to his mostly passive stock portfolio.

U.S. stock funds charge an average 0.7% compared with passive funds’ 0.1%. Taxable-bond fund average expense ratios are 0.53% for active and 0.12% for passive.

A broad shift from passive to active isn’t glaring in fund-flow data, but some trends are notable. The cheapest active funds steadily saw inflows throughout the bull market, according to Morningstar. The firm also notes that in January and February of this year, a net $24 billion went into active funds. Sure, that’s significantly less than the $78 billion that went into index funds, but it ended a 10-month trend of steady net outflows.

Investors reversed course in March and yanked massive assets out of both active and passive funds. Jitters continued in April, but a more granular look shows that investors pulled far less out of actively managed U.S. stock funds than passive, and that actively managed stock sector funds had net inflows.

The emphasis on active strategies goes beyond mutual funds and ETFs. Some advisors say the pullback in asset prices has prompted them to allocate more to private investments and other nontraditional asset classes.

“We’re looking at some private-equity and venture strategies that we passed on in the fall because of pricing, but now pricing has come down,” says Deb Wetherby, founder and CEO of Wetherby Asset Management in San Francisco. Real estate and private lending are among the areas of interest, she says.

Some advisors say that while they haven’t expanded active allocations, they’ve been elbow-deep in assessing their current managers.

“Moving forward, active managers will be able to add the most value in areas such as technology, health care, parts of finance, and consumer,” says Kent Insley, managing director at Tiedemann Wealth.” He particularly likes Akre Focus (AKREX), which has more than 75% in cyclical stocks such as financial services and real estate, and has beaten its benchmark and at least 90% of its peers in the trailing three-, five-, and 10-year periods through May 12.

As markets continue to roil, many advisors say they’ve been spending days conferencing from their home offices with colleagues to discuss strategies for the next few quarters. Gary Hager, president and founder of Integrated Wealth Management in Red Bank, N.J., is a big believer in passive investing, but is prepared to move about 10% of his portfolios to active management if the market delivers another pullback. “Because of the speed and violence of the market’s move down and up in the first quarter, there was never an opportunity to implement our plan,” he says. Given continued economic duress, he adds, “I suspect there will be.”

175,5 Tech Stocks to Mend a Coronavirus-Clobbered Portfolio,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-tech-stocks-mend-coronavirus-120912555.html,2020-05-20 12:09:12+00:00,"The coronavirus-battered U.S. economy is expected to get a lifeline as the country’s 50 states are likely to limp back to normalcy with at least partial reopening this week.



The states’ endeavors received further support from President Donald Trump after he signed an executive order on May 20, which aims at relaxing regulations that hamper economic recovery.



Investors should consider these developments as green signals to park their money in equities although markets are expected to remain volatile in the near term.



Tech stocks are definitely the best bets at present, considering their resilient nature and impressive prospects. Notably, the S&P 500 Information Technology Index is up 4% year to date versus the loss of 9.5% for the S&P 500 Index.



Prospects Galore in Tech Space



Technology stocks remain attractive owing to consistent digital transformation in the sector. Rapid adoption of cloud computing along with the ongoing infusion of AI and machine learning as well as the accelerated deployment of 5G technology, blockchain, IoT, autonomous vehicles, AR/VR and wearables are major tailwinds.



Coronavirus-induced work-from-home as well as online-learning wave is not only driving demand for computers and peripherals but also for remote-working management tools and video conferencing software. Furthermore, a solid uptake of AI-infused virtual assistants steadily perks up demand for smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home.



Moreover, a strong trend of lapping up online gaming, music and video-streaming services, which further received a boost from the coronavirus-led lockdowns and shelter-in-home guidelines, is a major lever.



Contactless payment and delivery also gained a significant traction from the coronavirus outbreak. Further, an e-commerce boom prompted by changing consumer behavior is a key catalyst.



Here we pick five tech stocks that apart from boasting strong fundamentals carry a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.



Per the Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with such a perfect mix of elements offer solid investment opportunities.



These fundamentally robust stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 composite on a year-to-date basis.

Year-to-Date Performance







Best Buys



VeriSign VRSN benefits from solid growth in .com and .net domain name registrations. An expected increase in domain name base is a positive. This Zacks #1 Ranked stock with a Growth Score of A is expected to cash in on the pervasive Internet consumption globally.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 earnings is pegged at $6.62 per share, having been revised 27.3% upward in the past 30 days. Earnings are expected to grow 24.7% from the figure reported in the previous year.



Fortinet FTNT is benefiting from its dominance in the Unified Threat Management (UTM) space, which is one of the fastest-evolving segments in Network Security. Solid adoption of Fortinet’s UTM solutions is major driver. Fortinet has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score A.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fortinet’s 2020 earnings stands at $2.75 per share, having moved 5.8% north over the past 30 days. Earnings are expected to grow 11.3% from the figure reported in the preceding year.



ServiceNow NOW is advancing on the back of a rapid adoption of its wide-ranged application-based products across all industries. This Zacks #2 Ranked company’s expanding global presence, strong partnerships and strategic buyouts are expected to aid its financial performance in the near term.



ServiceNow also has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for fiscal 2020 earnings is pegged at $4.24 per share, having been raised 1.4% in the past 30 days. Earnings are expected to grow 27.7% from the figure reported a year earlier.



NVIDIA NVDA is making progress on the back of sturdy growth in GeForce desktop and notebook GPUs, which is bumping up its gaming revenues. Moreover, an uptick in Hyperscale demand is a tailwind for this #2 Ranked stock’s data-center business. Additionally, ray-traced gaming, rendering, high-performance computing, AI and self-driving cars are a boon for the company.



The consensus mark for NViDIA’s fiscal 2021 earnings has inched up 0.5% to $7.50 over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 29.5% from the year-ago reported figure.



Apple AAPL benefits from a continued momentum in the Services segment, boosted by a robust performance of App Store, Apple Music, Video and cloud services. Moreover, the speedy acceptance of contactless payment bolsters the usage of Apple Card, which is a key catalyst.



Apple has a Zacks Rank of 2 and a Growth Score of B. The consensus mark for fiscal 2020 earnings is pegged at $12.31 per share, having moved 0.7% north in the past 30 days. Earnings are expected to climb 3.5% from the prior-year reported number.





Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?



Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.



Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.

3 Blue-Chip Tech Stocks to Buy as Amazon & Others Return to Highs

Technology stocks helped drive the historic bull market that the coronavirus brought to an abrupt end. Some of these same tech powers, and the industry in general, have picked up right where they left off during the market’s two-month rally.

The S&P 500 has surged 32% from its March 23 lows, as Wall Street looks ahead to a coronavirus recovery. On top of that, investors remain in ‘don’t fight the Fed’ mode as the central bank does all it can to support the market, as the U.S. government provides economic stimulus.

Meanwhile, stocks jumped to start the week on the back of positive coronavirus vaccine news. This came as economies around the world slowly begin to reopen from their coronavirus-induced lockdowns.

That said, the full impact of the coronavirus shutdown won’t be seen until second quarter earnings, and the economic data seems sure to get worse. Still, as stocks jump, for all the reasons we mentioned, investors might want to consider buying some of the safer tech plays.

These come in the form of blue-chip giants such as Amazon, which hit new highs Wednesday, as its e-commerce and cloud spaces prove somewhat immune to the coronavirus. So here are 3 blue-chip tech stocks that investors might want to buy…

Facebook

FB hit new highs Wednesday after it announced its new Shops offering that will enable users and businesses to essentially create a streamlined version of their e-commerce sites directly on Facebook and some of its other services. FB’s latest e-commerce push comes as retailers around the world struggle, and is part of its larger push, through Marketplace and Instagram, to compete in a growing market against Amazon and others.

Facebook in April said it would pay $5.7 billion for roughly 10% of Indian telecom powerhouse Jio Platforms Ltd. The move is bet on the huge Indian market where FB already has over 400 million WhatsApp users. Plus, the social media power posted solid Q1 results, with daily active users up 11% to 1.73 billion. This growth helped Facebook’s Q1 revenue pop 18% to reach $17.74 billion. And executives also calmed Wall Street nerves about its advertising sales during the coronavirus.

Despite its 60% climb since mid-March and sitting right near new highs, FB stock is trading at a discount against its own one-year highs. Facebook’s balance sheet is also strong and its cash pile will help it weather any coronavirus storms and continue its expansion into e-commerce, augmented reality, and more.

FB is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that longer-term investors might want to look at because its nearly 2.6 billion monthly users makes it an advertising titan, especially in an age where people pay not to see ads on Netflix and elsewhere.

Apple

Apple is clearly another safe tech bet at the moment despite pandemic-related iPhone setbacks. AAPL beat our Q2 fiscal 2020 estimates at the end of April, driven by growth in its non-iPhone units. Apple’s services division saw its revenue jump roughly 17%. Meanwhile, its wearables unit climbed 23% to a new quarterly record. Perhaps more importantly, given the unprecedented times, Apple closed the period with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities, alongside total debt of $110 billion. This left it with $83 billion in net cash.

Apple also lifted its quarterly dividend by 6% and its current 1.03% yield easily tops the 10-year U.S. Treasury’s 0.66%. On top of all of that, Apple’s board authorized a $50 billion increase to the stock buyback program, at a time when fellow giants suspended their repurchase programs.

Shares of Apple have surged 40% since March 23 and it currently sits just 3% below its 52-week highs. AAPL is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now that sports “B” grades for both Value and Growth in our Style Scores system. Even near its highs, longer-term investors will likely look back in a year from now and wish they could buy Apple at its current price.

177,"Americans use their $1,200 stimulus checks to splurge at Walmart, Target, BJ’s and Best Buy — here’s what they’re buying",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20,2020-05-20 00:00:00,"While many Americans have used their stimulus checks to cover basic needs such as groceries, mortgage or rent, there’s evidence people are also spending the money on non-essentials including electronics, clothes and toys, according to major retailers.

“Call it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars, leading to sales increases in categories such as apparel, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys,” Walmart WMT, -0.52% Chief Executive Doug McMillon said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday.

Target TGT, -1.00% , BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings Inc. BJ, +5.22% and Best Buy Co. BBY, -1.35% also saw increased consumer demand for discretionary goods in mid-April as the stimulus payments from the $2.2-trillion CARES Act flowed into Americans’ bank accounts, the companies’ CEOs said this week. Apple AAPL, +0.64% saw an uptick in demand for its products “across the board,” CEO Tim Cook said April 30.

“ At Walmart and Target, shoppers bought more TVs, electronics, gaming equipment and apparel. Walmart also saw more demand for adult-sized bikes. ”

At Walmart, Target, shoppers bought more TVs, electronics, gaming equipment and apparel. Walmart also saw increased demand for adult-sized bikes.

BJ’s CEO Lee Delaney told investors on Thursday that the company saw “relatively significant growth” in discretionary categories, including electronics and TVs.

“We would imagine that there is certainly an impact from stimulus checks that are impacting the business,” Delaney said. “But I think it’s right to assume there is some benefit flowing through from stimulus checks in the business.”

(BJ’s did not respond to a request for a further comment.)

At Best Buy, customers used their stimulus checks to buy computing and gaming equipment, Corie Barry, the company’s CEO, said on it Thursday earnings call.

“Like many other retailers, we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide,” Barry said.

(Best Buy did not respond to a request for a further comment.)

The different phases of the pandemic have shaped shoppers’ choices. As stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country, “parents became teachers,” McMillon said on Walmart’s earnings call. “Adult bicycles started selling out, as parents started to join the kids. An overlapping trend then started emerging related to DIY and home-related activities.”

Consumers also bought sewing machines and bandanas to make their own face masks, he said.

Sales took off in mid-April when many Americans began to receive their $1,200 stimulus checks. Within 10 days of receiving their stimulus checks, households spent around one quarter to one third of it, research shows.

Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was “not as much demand” for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove, adding that sales increased “towards the end of the quarter.”

Target Corp. also experienced “a rapid increase in traffic and sales” for discretionary goods driven by the distribution of stimulus checks, CEO Brian Cornell said on the company’s Wednesday earnings call. “We certainly saw an uptick as we reported starting on April 15, as those checks arrived across America,” Cornell said on the company’s call.

“ Before the checks were issued on April 15, there was ‘not as much demand’ for discretionary goods at Walmart, said spokesman Randy Hargrove ”

Customers, he said, are “still seeing the benefits of the stimulus check.” People are shopping across all categories including apparel, which has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn.

(Costco COST, +0.15% declined to comment on whether it has experienced the same trend in sales related to stimulus payments.)

iPhone maker Apple also saw sales increase after stimulus payments went out, Cook said on the company’s April 30 earnings call. “A part of it is due to just our new products,” Cook said. But another part of it is also “due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April.” (Apple did not respond to MarketWatch’s request for a further comment.)

Unlike Target and Walmart, which have remained open during the coronavirus outbreak and can sell apparel in-stores, “non-esential” clothing retailers including Gap GAP, +1.35% , Nordstrom NRD, +3.67% and Nike NKE, -0.54% have been forced to close many stores across the country. As a result, retailers in the apparel industry have offered consumers online deals comparable to Cyber Monday.

Still, many Americans have used their stimulus checks to stock up on essentials. That’s especially true for those who received their checks in the first wave of stimulus payments, said Stuart Sopp, CEO and founder of Current, a New York City-based mobile-banking startup.

In mid-April when payments were initially distributed, “most people immediately spent on groceries,” said Sopp. Many Current members, he said, also took cash out of ATMs to “pay friends back and pay their bills.” He added, “People were struggling for basic life essentials and the stimulus payments really helped them, which I think is what it was all about.”

In the next wave of payments, which occurred towards the end of April, more people used the funds “for everyday means,” Sopp said. That included ordering more food delivery and takeout, and gas.

The $3 trillion coronavirus aid package the House of Representatives passed last week, dubbed the HEROS Act, calls for a second round of stimulus checks. President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that they are in no rush to sign the relief package to law. Trump has shown support for a second round of stimulus checks.

If people do end up receiving a second stimulus check, Sopp predicts most will use the money for the same purposes.

Best Buy’s Barry said Thursday that “the impact of current to potential future government stimulus actions” is something the company will keep an eye on “for the remainder of the year.”"

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:

Google, Apple Launch Contact-Tracing App: FAANG Stocks to Gain

On May 20, Alphabet, Inc.’s Google and Apple, Inc. released the initial version of their COVID-19 contact-tracing app. The companies said that authorities of 23 countries across five continents have sought access to their contact-tracing technology.

The technology has been designed to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus by tracking who a person has been in close contact with. Tech players, particularly the FAANG companies, have been playing a major role in fighting the coronavirus. While most industries have taken a beating due to the pandemic, tech players have been one of the few to have not only survived the pandemic but also put up a great show.

Google, Apple Show the Way

Apple and Google on May 20 made available the first public version of their exposure notification API, which originally debuted as a joint contact-tracing software tool. The technology uses a Bluetooth-based system to store data on people’s phones and not a central database. If a person tests positive for COVID-19, the system can send notification to anyone who was recently near that person and alerts them to contact the local authority to get medical advice and a coronavirus test.

Apple and Google will not be making the actual contact-tracing app but only share their technology. The apps will be developed by the respective governments and health bodies that have requested for the technology. Notably, the technology has been included in iPhone and Android updates released to the public on May 20. Shares of Apple and Google have gained 15.3% and 11.7%, respectively, over the past 30 days. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Google carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

FAANG Companies Fight COVID-19

Lately, federal regulators have been scrutinizing how the likes of Facebook, Inc. Google and others handle personal information amid rapidly increasing incidences of user data breach.

The COVID-19 outbreak has given tech companies an opportunity to rebuild their image. At the same time, an increasing number of people are relying on online purchases, with stay-at-home orders in place. This has seen a rise in e-commerce sales, growth in demand for video and online games, and a surge in users of streaming services.

On May 19, Facebook rolled out Facebook Shops, a feature allows businesses to set up product listings on their Facebook Page, Instagram profile, Stories or in ads. Users can browse and buy products directly from a business’ Facebook page or Instagram profile. Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3. Its shares have gained 29% in the past 30 days.

Netflix, Inc. has been one of the biggest winners during the pandemic. Last month, the streaming giant said that it added 15.8 million subscribers in the first quarter, taking its global total to 182.9 million. The company had predicted that it would add around 7 million customers during the period. Netflix said that it users grew only in mid-March when stay-at-home restrictions were well in place. Shares of Netflix, which has a Zacks Rank #2, have increased 2.3% in the last one month.

Similarly, Amazon.com, Inc. too has been making the most of the opportunity. So much so, that the e-commerce giant had to go on a hiring spree. Last month, Amazon said that it will be hiring 75,000 more heads, ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers to ramp up delivery services and meet the growing demand for online orders. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3. The company’s shares have gained 4.4% in the past one month.

The coronavirus outbreak has also given tech companies a chance to rebuild their image by fighting fake news. Last month, Facebook launched a service in Italy in collaboration with Facta that will allow users to verify the authenticity of any information related to the novel coronavirus."

(23:40) - Stock Screener And Tracey’s Top Stock Picks

(33:00) - Episode Roundup: ABBV, BGS, HRB, MSFT, AAPL

Podcast@Zacks.com

Welcome to Episode #191 of the Value Investor Podcast.

Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

At the 2020 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May 2020, Warren Buffett again discussed his investing mentor, Benjamin Graham, describing him as one of the smartest people he’s ever met.

He also said that Graham’s Book, The Intelligent Investor, changed his life.

First published in 1949, The Intelligent Investor was the first investing book to be written for Mom and Pop investors.

Tracey has covered several different chapters of the 600 page book on previous podcasts.

But this week, given the volatility in the stock markets thanks to the coronavirus crisis, she tackled the final chapter, Chapter 20, appropriately titled: “Margin of Safety as the Central Concept of Investment”.

How Can You Find Margin of Safety Stocks?

Graham discusses investing in companies that have paid dividends over a number of years and in abnormal market conditions, such as a recession.

As we have seen this year, many companies have suspended their dividend due to the uncertainty around COVID-19.

But what about those companies that are still paying it?

And what if they also were Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy), which hopefully means rising earnings estimates?

5 Margin of Safety Stocks

1. AbbVie ABBV just closed on its big acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) drug maker is paying a dividend yielding 5.2%. It’s also dirt cheap, with a forward P/E of just 8.5.

2. B&G Foods BGS is having its day in the sun as Americans are buying packaged foods in droves thanks to the coronavirus shutdowns. It has 50 brands in its arsenal including Green Giant, Spice Islands and Cream of Wheat. It recently announced its dividend, the 63rd consecutive payment to shareholders. It’s currently yielding 8.2%.

3. H&R Block, Inc. HRB is apparently still paying the dividend which is yielding 6.3%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is the cheapest stock here, with a forward P/E of just 5.3.

4. Microsoft MSFT has been paying a dividend for over a decade and with its cash hoard, is unlikely to suspend it during the crisis. But shareholders are only getting a yield of 1.1% and investors will have to pay 32x forward earnings to own it.

5. Apple AAPL also has a big cash hoard, so it too should easily be able to pay its dividend during 2020. But it’s yielding even less, at just 1%, as the tech giant’s forward P/E has risen to its highest in over a decade, at 25.

What else should you know about Benjamin Graham and the book that changed Warren Buffett’s life?

Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.

[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of MSFT in her personal portfolio.]

5 Stocks Set to Double

Each was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.

Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.

180,Warren Buffett's Top 5 Holdings as of the 1st Quarter,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-top-5-holdings-225206021.html,2020-05-22 22:52:06+00:00,"According to top 10 holdings statistics, a Premium feature of GuruFocus, the top five holdings of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) as of the March quarter-end were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP) and Wells Fargo & Co.

The popular podcaster sold his 11-year-old “The Joe Rogan Experience” series to Spotify SPOT, -1.33% in a licensing deal that’s reportedly worth more than $100 million, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Rogan’s full library — which adds up to almost 1,500 episodes, which weren’t available on the streaming service before — will hit Spotify beginning Sept. 1. Episodes of the video podcast are currently available on YouTube, but will move off the Alphabet GOOG, +0.54% platform to be exclusive to Spotify by the end of the year.

Rogan, 52, told his millions of fans via Instagram FB, +1.52% on Thursday that “it will be the exact same show” that they’ve come to love, emphasizing that, “I am not going to be an employee of Spotify,” and he’ll be working with the same production crew.

“The only difference will be, it will now be available on the largest audio platform in the world,” he added. “It will be free to you; you will just have to go to Spotify to get it.”

But for those who aren’t among the reported 190 million people who download “The Joe Rogan Experience” each month, here are five things to know about the stand-up comic and former Ultimate Fighting Championship interviewer who’s become Forbes’ top-earning podcaster.

You might recognize him from TV. Before launching “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast in 2009, Rogan appeared on Fox’s “Hardball” as a star basketball player, and on NBC’s “NewsRadio” as a handyman and conspiracy theorist. He was also the host of “Fear Factor” from 2001 to 2006, and he’s done stand-up specials for Netflix NFLX, -1.58% and Comedy Central. He cut his interviewing chops doing color commentary for the UFC, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards.

He’s also married to model-turned-producer Jessica Ditzel, and they have three daughters.

He was already making $30 million a year before joining Spotify. Rogan topped Forbes’ inaugural highest-earning podcaster list earlier this year, pulling in a reported $30 million and running the No. 1 podcast in the world, according to Apple AAPL, +0.64% . “He’s delivering scale and engagement,” Tom Webster, senior vice president at Edison Research, told Forbes. “He’s the No. 1 in terms of reach in the U.S.”

He’s praised Bernie Sanders, but will probably vote for Trump. While Rogan has expressed some liberal views, such as supporting the legalization of marijuana, he recently revealed that he will probably vote for Trump this November because he just “can’t vote” for presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden. “I’d rather vote for Trump than [Biden]. I don’t think he can handle anything. You’re relying entirely on his cabinet,” he said. “If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can’t do that. And we don’t know what the f— he’ll be like after a year in office.”

Yet in January, he suggested that he would vote for Bernie Sanders, largely because the liberal Vermont Senator has been “insanely consistent his entire life.” The Sanders campaign was quick to tweet out this unofficial endorsement its official Twitter TWTR, +0.86% feed at the time.

He appeared to smoke pot with Elon Musk on the air. One of Rogan’s most notorious interviews came in September 2018, when Tesla TSLA, -1.29% CEO Elon Musk sat down and appeared to smoke weed with him on the air. (It should be noted they were filming in California, where recreational marijuana is legal.) Watch the video below; the smoking begins about 2 hours and 10 minutes in.

He’s drawn backlash for giving Alex Jones a platform, and making offensive remarks. Rogan has been a controversial figure, in part for his interviews with the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos and axed Google engineer James Damore. Perhaps even more notorious than his Musk Q&A, however, were his two marathon interviews with InfoWars founder and conspiracy theorist Jones, who has said the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 children was a hoax. The second Jones interview was a five-hour marathon that saw him claim that the U.S. government was making intergalactic deals with aliens by using psychedelic drugs.

Rogan has also made plenty of his own controversial remarks on his show and in his stand-up that have been called racist, sexist and transphobic by critics. They include comparing a black neighborhood to “Planet of the Apes,” and saying that mixed martial artist Fallon Fox, who is a transgender woman, is “a f---ing man.” He has said such remarks were taken out of context."
183,"Apple Looking To Diversify Its Manufacturing Base, Will Make Headphones In Vietnam",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-looking-diversify-manufacturing-headphones-072853788.html,2020-05-20 07:28:53+00:00,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is looking to shift the manufacturing of its over-ear AirPods Studio headphones away from China.

What Happened

Apple will now make its new Studio range of headphones in Vietnam. This is the first time ever that the Cupertino-based tech giant has produced an entirely new product in Vietnam, according to 9to5Mac, an Apple news website.

Goertek Inc., an acoustics components firm and Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd, an Apple supplier, will assemble the headphones in Vietnam. Shipments to Apple would commence in June or July, with product release planned for late summer or early fall. Mass production is slated to begin mid-2020.

Why It Matters

The underlying reason for the shift of manufacturing to Vietnam is said to be “political and trade tensions” between the United States and China, reported 9to5Mac.

Some of the headphones will still be built by contract manufacturers in China, but even shifting some of the manufacturing away from the country is an indication of Apple’s intention of diversifying its manufacturing base.

Apple’s operations executives suggested in 2015 that the company move at least one product’s manufacturing to Vietnam. This would have given Apple a chance to begin the years-long process of training workers and creating a new group of component providers outside of China.

Apple has plans to move almost a fifth of its production capacity from China to India in order to take advantage of the Indian government’s new production-linked incentives scheme.

Price Action

Apple shares traded 1.40% higher at $314.54 in the after-hours session on Tuesday. The shares had closed the regular session 0.58% higher at $313.14.
